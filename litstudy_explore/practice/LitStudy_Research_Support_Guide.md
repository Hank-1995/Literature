# LitStudy: Advanced Research and Writing Support Tool

## Overview

**LitStudy** is a powerful Python package that extends the AI agent capabilities demonstrated in the `introduction_to_agent` workshop by providing specialized tools for scientific literature analysis. While the previous labs focused on basic AI agent operations like file processing, text extraction, and reference management, LitStudy adds sophisticated bibliometric analysis, network visualization, and topic modeling capabilities.

## How LitStudy Builds on Previous Workshop Content

### From Basic AI Agent Operations to Advanced Research Tools

The `introduction_to_agent` workshop covered fundamental AI agent capabilities:
- **Lab 0**: Reference extraction and list creation
- **Lab 1**: Web search and data collection
- **Lab 2**: PDF processing and text extraction
- **Lab 3**: Data analysis and visualization
- **Lab 4**: Report generation and formatting
- **Lab 5**: Advanced document processing

LitStudy extends these capabilities by providing:
- **Automated literature collection** from multiple academic databases
- **Advanced bibliometric analysis** beyond simple reference extraction
- **Network analysis** to understand research relationships
- **Topic modeling** for thematic analysis
- **Interactive visualizations** for research insights

## Core Capabilities for Research and Writing

### 1. **Multi-Source Literature Collection**
```python
import litstudy

# Collect from multiple sources
scopus_papers = litstudy.load_scopus("your_api_key")
arxiv_papers = litstudy.load_arxiv()
crossref_papers = litstudy.load_crossref()

# Combine datasets
combined_dataset = litstudy.merge([scopus_papers, arxiv_papers, crossref_papers])
```

**Research Support**: Automates the literature search process that was manually demonstrated in Lab 1, but with access to academic databases and standardized metadata extraction.

### 2. **Advanced Reference Management**
```python
# Deduplicate and clean references
clean_dataset = litstudy.deduplicate(combined_dataset)
annotated_dataset = litstudy.annotate(clean_dataset, 
                                   fields=['authors', 'venue', 'year', 'citations'])

# Filter by criteria
recent_papers = annotated_dataset.filter(lambda doc: doc.year >= 2020)
high_impact = annotated_dataset.filter(lambda doc: doc.citations > 50)
```

**Research Support**: Extends the reference extraction from Lab 0 with sophisticated deduplication, annotation, and filtering capabilities.

### 3. **Bibliometric Statistics and Visualization**
```python
# Generate publication statistics
stats = litstudy.compute_stats(annotated_dataset)
print(f"Total papers: {stats.num_documents}")
print(f"Unique authors: {stats.num_authors}")
print(f"Publication years: {stats.year_range}")

# Create publication timeline
litstudy.plot_timeline(annotated_dataset)
litstudy.plot_authors(annotated_dataset, top_n=20)
litstudy.plot_venues(annotated_dataset)
```

**Research Support**: Provides quantitative analysis of research trends, author productivity, and venue preferences - essential for literature review sections.

### 4. **Network Analysis for Research Relationships**
```python
# Author collaboration network
author_network = litstudy.create_author_network(annotated_dataset)
litstudy.plot_network(author_network, layout='spring')

# Citation network
citation_network = litstudy.create_citation_network(annotated_dataset)
litstudy.plot_network(citation_network, layout='hierarchical')

# Co-authorship analysis
coauthorship = litstudy.compute_coauthorship(annotated_dataset)
```

**Research Support**: Reveals research communities, collaboration patterns, and citation relationships that inform research positioning and identify key researchers.

### 5. **Topic Modeling and Thematic Analysis**
```python
# Extract topics from abstracts
topics = litstudy.extract_topics(annotated_dataset, 
                               field='abstract', 
                               num_topics=10)

# Visualize topic distribution
litstudy.plot_topic_distribution(topics)
litstudy.plot_topic_evolution(topics, time_field='year')

# Get papers for each topic
for topic_id, topic_papers in topics.items():
    print(f"Topic {topic_id}: {len(topic_papers)} papers")
```

**Research Support**: Automatically identifies research themes and trends, supporting the development of research questions and literature review structure.

## Integration with AI Agent Workflows

### Enhanced Document Processing Pipeline

Building on the PDF processing from Lab 2, LitStudy provides:

```python
# Process multiple document formats
documents = []
for source in ['scopus', 'arxiv', 'crossref']:
    docs = litstudy.load_from_source(source, query="machine learning")
    documents.extend(docs)

# Advanced text processing
processed_docs = litstudy.process_documents(documents,
                                           extract_abstracts=True,
                                           extract_keywords=True,
                                           compute_similarities=True)
```

### Automated Report Generation

Extending the report generation from Lab 4:

```python
# Generate comprehensive literature analysis report
report = litstudy.generate_report(processed_docs,
                                include_stats=True,
                                include_networks=True,
                                include_topics=True,
                                format='markdown')

# Save report
with open('literature_analysis_report.md', 'w') as f:
    f.write(report)
```

## Practical Applications for Research Writing
