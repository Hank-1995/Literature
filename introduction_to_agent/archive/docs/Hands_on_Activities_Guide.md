## üíª Activity 2: Code Generation and Data Analysis (15 minutes)

### Objective:
Experience AI agent code generation and execution capabilities

### Tasks:

#### Task 2.1: Generate Data Analysis Code (10 minutes)
**Instructions**:
1. Describe your research data needs
2. Ask AI agent to generate analysis code
3. Execute and modify the code

**Sample Data Scenario**:
```
"I have survey data from 200 students about their experience with AI tools in education. 
The data includes: age, major, AI tool usage, satisfaction ratings, and learning outcomes. 
I want to analyze the relationship between AI tool usage and learning outcomes."
```

**AI Agent Prompt Example**:
```
"Generate Python code to analyze survey data about AI tool usage in education. 
Include data loading, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and visualizations. 
The data has columns: age, major, ai_usage, satisfaction, learning_outcomes."
```

**Expected Output**:
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('survey_data.csv')

# Descriptive statistics
print(df.describe())

# Correlation analysis
correlation_matrix = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True)
plt.title('Correlation Matrix: AI Usage and Learning Outcomes')
plt.show()

# AI usage vs learning outcomes
plt.scatter(df['ai_usage'], df['learning_outcomes'])
plt.xlabel('AI Tool Usage')
plt.ylabel('Learning Outcomes')
plt.title('AI Usage vs Learning Outcomes')
plt.show()
```

#### Task 2.2: Debug and Modify Code (5 minutes)
**Instructions**:
1. Introduce an error in the generated code
2. Ask AI agent to debug and fix
3. Modify code for additional analysis

**AI Agent Prompt Example**:
```
"The code has an error when loading the data. The file is actually an Excel file, 
not CSV. Also, I want to add a regression analysis to predict learning outcomes 
based on AI usage and other factors."
```

## üîç Activity 3: Web Search and Information Gathering (15 minutes)

### Objective:
Learn to use AI agents for research information gathering

3. Analyze and synthesize findings

**Research Topic Example**:
```
"Find recent research (2023-2024) on the impact of AI tools on student learning outcomes in higher education. 
Focus on empirical studies with quantitative data."
```

**AI Agent Prompt Example**:
```
"Search for recent empirical studies on AI tools in higher education. 
Look for papers published in 2023-2024 that include quantitative data on learning outcomes. 
Extract key findings, methodologies, and research gaps."
```

**Expected Output**:
- List of relevant papers with abstracts
- Key findings summary
- Methodology analysis
- Research gaps identification

#### Task 3.2: Information Synthesis (5 minutes)
**Instructions**:
