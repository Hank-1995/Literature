# Introduction to AI Agents - Workshop Materials

This folder contains materials for the **Introduction to AI Agents** demonstration, organized into four main directories to support different aspects of the workshop.

## üìÅ Folder Structure and Purpose

### üìä **`data/` - Input Data for AI Agents**
**Purpose**: This folder contains all the input files that students will use with AI agents during the workshop.

**What goes here**:
- Sample research papers (PDF, TXT, MD formats)
- Datasets for analysis (CSV, JSON, Excel files)
- Example documents for processing
- Test files for AI agent operations
- Any files that students need to analyze or process

**Example files**:
- `sample_paper.pdf` - Research paper for analysis
- `survey_data.csv` - Dataset for statistical analysis
- `research_notes.md` - Notes to be processed by AI agent
- `example_code.py` - Code file for AI agent to review

**Usage**: Students will use these files to practice AI agent operations like document analysis, data processing, and file management.

### üìö **`docs/` - Instructions and Documentation**
**Purpose**: This folder contains all instructional materials, chat histories, and documentation for instructors.

**What goes here**:
- Step-by-step instructions for instructors
- Chat histories showing AI agent interactions
- Teaching guides and lesson plans
- Troubleshooting guides
- Example prompts and responses
- Workshop facilitation notes

**Example files**:
- `instructor_guide.md` - Step-by-step teaching instructions
- `chat_history_example.md` - Sample AI agent conversations
- `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `prompt_examples.md` - Example prompts for students

**Usage**: Instructors use these materials to guide students through AI agent demonstrations and activities.

### üéØ **`practice/` - Student Practice Files**
**Purpose**: This folder contains files that students will edit, modify, and practice with during hands-on activities.

**What goes here**:
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive practice
- Template files for students to fill in
- Exercise files with incomplete code
- Practice datasets for analysis
- Worksheets and activity templates

**Example files**:
- `ai_agent_basics.ipynb` - Interactive practice notebook

### üêç **`scripts/` - Python Scripts**
**Purpose**: This folder contains executable Python scripts that demonstrate AI agent capabilities and can be run by students.

**What goes here**:
- Standalone Python scripts for demonstrations
- Data processing scripts
- Analysis scripts
- Utility scripts for AI agent operations
- Example implementations

**Example files**:
- `demo_analysis.py` - Script to demonstrate data analysis
- `file_processor.py` - Script for file operations
- `web_scraper.py` - Script for web data collection
- `report_generator.py` - Script for automated report generation

**Usage**: Students can run these scripts to see AI agent capabilities in action and learn from the code examples.
