**Cursor**

I'll help you create additional lab instructions (lab 2-5) based on the patterns from the existing lab0 and lab1 instructions. Let me first read the existing instruction files to understand the structure and patterns.


Now I'll create a todo list to track the creation of lab instructions 2-5, then create each lab instruction file following the established patterns.


Based on the patterns I observed, I'll create lab instructions 2-5. The existing labs follow this structure:
- Title with brief description
- Input section with file paths
- Process section describing what the AI should do
- Output section with destination
- "What we learn here" section explaining the learning objectives

Let me create each lab instruction:


```markdown
Lab 2: AI agent performs data analysis and generates insights

# Note for workshop participants: please change the file paths in the file before sending the file path to the AI agent chat
