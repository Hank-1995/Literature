The analysis reveals that Generative AI has significant potential to support research writing and ERPP, particularly for second-language learners and students developing academic writing skills. However, successful integration requires careful attention to critical thinking development, ethical considerations, and institutional support. The most relevant studies emphasize the need for balanced approaches that leverage AI capabilities while maintaining academic integrity and fostering independent thinking skills.

Future research should focus on developing comprehensive frameworks for AI-assisted research writing, investigating long-term impacts on writing quality, and creating effective training programs for both students and educators in the responsible use of AI tools for academic purposes.
