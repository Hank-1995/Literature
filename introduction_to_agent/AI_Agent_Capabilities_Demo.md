## 1. üóÇÔ∏è Direct File System Operations & Code Execution

**What this means**: I can actually read, write, and execute files on your computer, not just provide text advice.

### Example 1: Automated Reference Extraction
**Task**: Extract all references from a research paper and save them to a new file.

**What I can do**:
- Read the actual paper file (`Cheng2025.md`)
- Parse the content to find the references section
- Extract all 27 cited papers with proper formatting
- Save the results to a new markdown file (`ListRef.md`)

**Result**: Created a structured list of 27 references with publication years (2005-2025) and research focus areas.

### Example 2: Web Research & Report Generation
**Task**: Research UNESCO AI literacy framework and generate a comprehensive report.

**What I can do**:
- Read the input file about UNESCO framework
- Perform live web searches to find current articles
- Extract URLs, summaries, and key information
- Generate a formatted report with search terms and findings
- Save the report to a specified output file

**Result**: Created `webResultsLab1.md` with documented search process and findings.

### Example 3: Code Execution & Data Processing
**What I can do**:
- Execute Python scripts to analyze research papers
- Process large datasets and generate analysis reports
- Run terminal commands to install packages or set up environments
- Create executable code that students can run immediately

## 2. üîó Multi-Tool Integration & Workflow Automation

**What this means**: I can orchestrate complex workflows that connect different software tools and languages.

### Example: Literature Analysis ‚Üí Bioinformatics Pipeline
**Workflow**: Paper Analysis ‚Üí Data Preparation ‚Üí R Analysis ‚Üí Results Integration

**Step 1: Literature Analysis (Python)**
```python
# Extract methods from Badia-i-Mompel et al. (2023) paper
- Identify 10+ GRN inference methods (WGCNA, GENIE3, SCENIC, etc.)
- Extract 15+ bioinformatics tools (motifmatchr, FIMO, HOMER, etc.)
- Find 8+ databases (JASPAR, TRANSFAC, HOCOMOCO, etc.)
- Count method mentions and identify most relevant tools
```

**Step 2: Data Preparation (Python)**
```python
# Create example ATAC-seq peaks data
- Generate BED format files for genomic regions
- Create CSV files with peak annotations
- Prepare data for R/motifmatchr analysis
```

**Step 3: R Analysis Script Generation**
```r
# Generate executable R script for motif analysis
- Load genomic regions (ATAC-seq peaks)
- Set up motif matching with motifmatchr
- Include paper-specific context and citations
- Export results for further analysis
```

**Step 4: Integration Documentation**
- Create comprehensive guide linking all steps
- Document tool dependencies and workflows
- Provide reproducible examples

**Result**: Seamless workflow from literature ‚Üí data ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí results

### Example: UNESCO AI Literacy Framework Research
**Input**: UNESCO framework document
**Process**:
1. **Live Web Search**: Search for current articles about UNESCO AI literacy
2. **Information Extraction**: Find relevant URLs, summaries, and key points
3. **Cross-Referencing**: Compare multiple sources and identify patterns
4. **Synthesis**: Create comprehensive report with actionable insights

**Output**: Detailed report with:
- Search terms used
- Web pages found with URLs
- Article summaries and key findings
- Recommendations for further research

### Example: Bioinformatics Tool Discovery
**Process**:
1. **Literature Mining**: Extract tool names from research papers
2. **Web Validation**: Search for current tool versions and documentation
3. **Integration Research**: Find how tools work together
4. **Documentation Generation**: Create usage guides and examples

## 4. üîÑ Interactive Problem-Solving & Iterative Development

**What this means**: I can work with you through complex problems step-by-step, adapting as we go.

### Example: Research Workflow Development
**Initial Task**: "Help me analyze gene regulatory networks"

**Iterative Process**:
1. **Break Down**: Identify sub-tasks (literature review, data prep, analysis, visualization)
2. **Progress Tracking**: Update on each completed step
3. **Feedback Loop**: Ask for your input before proceeding to next step
4. **Adaptation**: Modify approach based on intermediate results
5. **Debugging**: Fix issues as they arise in real-time

**Status Updates** (every 60 seconds as requested):
- ‚úÖ Completed literature analysis
- üîÑ Currently preparing data files
- ‚è≥ Next: Generate R analysis script
- ‚ùì Need your feedback on data format before proceeding

### Example: Code Development
**Process**:
1. **Initial Code**: Generate basic analysis script
2. **Testing**: Run code and identify errors
3. **Debugging**: Fix issues and improve functionality
4. **Enhancement**: Add features based on your feedback
5. **Documentation**: Create usage guide and examples

## 5. üéØ Context-Aware Research Assistance

**What this means**: I understand your specific research domain and provide personalized solutions.

### Example: Bioinformatics Research Context
**Domain Understanding**:
- Gene regulatory networks (GRN) inference
- Single-cell multi-omics data
- Transcription factor binding analysis
- ATAC-seq and RNA-seq integration

**Contextual Assistance**:
1. **Tool Selection**: Recommend motifmatchr + JASPAR based on paper analysis
2. **Method Adaptation**: Modify approaches for your specific cell type
3. **Parameter Optimization**: Suggest settings based on literature findings
4. **Integration Strategy**: Connect tools in ways relevant to your research

### Example: Personalized Workflow Creation
**Your Research**: "I'm studying transcription factors in cancer cells"

**Context-Aware Response**:
1. **Literature Focus**: Search for cancer-specific TF studies
2. **Tool Customization**: Adapt motif analysis for cancer cell lines
3. **Data Preparation**: Format your specific ATAC-seq data
4. **Analysis Pipeline**: Create cancer-focused GRN inference workflow
5. **Validation**: Include cancer-specific validation steps
