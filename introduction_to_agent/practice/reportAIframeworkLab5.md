## Conclusion

The literature reveals a rich ecosystem of AI literacy frameworks, each addressing different aspects of AI education across various educational levels. While there is no single consensus definition, common themes emerge around the importance of ethics, multi-dimensional competencies, and practical application. The frameworks demonstrate evolution from purely technical approaches to more holistic models that integrate cognitive, affective, social, and ethical dimensions of AI literacy.

The most comprehensive frameworks (Long & Magerko, 2020; Ng et al., 2021) provide detailed competency models that can guide curriculum development and assessment across educational levels. The Five Big Ideas framework offers a solid foundation for K-12 education, while specialized frameworks address specific contexts like higher education and professional development.

## Recommendations

1. **Adopt Multi-dimensional Approaches**: Implement frameworks that address knowledge, skills, attitudes, and ethics
2. **Emphasize Ethics**: Ensure AI ethics is integrated throughout all AI literacy programs
3. **Age-Appropriate Design**: Use frameworks specifically designed for target educational levels
4. **Practical Application**: Focus on real-world use cases and hands-on experiences
5. **Continuous Evolution**: Regularly update frameworks to reflect technological and societal changes
