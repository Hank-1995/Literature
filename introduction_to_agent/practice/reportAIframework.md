AI systems are often perceived as objective due to their binary nature (0s and 1s) and their ability to uncover universal laws and structures underlying observable phenomena (Mc Carty, 2024). This perception of objectivity is misleading because human involvement in data selection and algorithm design inherently introduces biases (Benjamin, 2020).

institutional, and student-level needs, universities need to prepare for the changing educational landscape in the age of AI. Numerous regulatory, policy, and educational initiatives (see Arnold et al., 2024) now aim to promote the responsible development of AI in particular. For instance, the U.S. Executive Order and the EU AI Act (European Union, 2024; The White House, 2023) represent key attempts to formalize responsible AI guidelines, with both government and non-government organizations pus...

Moreover, papers that discussed the ethics topics of the technological design and transparency of AI systems never used quantitative assessment, while papers that discussed the privacy of AI predominantly used quantitative assessment.

For instance, students can engage with controversial societal topics in a safe and “fictional” manner while engaging the emotional cognition of the student (Burton et al., 2018). One of the approaches we did not see, though, was the use of role-playing.

A common conceptual thread is that critical thinking involves evaluative reasoning, reflective skepticism, and the ability to analyze and interpret complex information in rapidly evolving digital environments (Chaparro-Banegas et al., 2024; Essel et al., 2024; Xu & Jumaat, 2024).

observing that many students engaged with Gen AI tools without awareness of privacy and data protection policies of using third-party platforms. On the other hand, Kajiwara and Kawabata (2024) found that students’ awareness of data security was related to their under- standing of Gen AI mechanisms such as how data sharing in Gen AI may lead to bias or misuse. Furthermore, students’ ability to manage privacy concerns was limited, indicating a critical necessity for targeted in- struction on data ...
