What we learn here: 
converting PDFs into markdown is essential for AI to process the literature; we can ask AI to write a Python program to convert the files (without worrying about the technical details) 
if you are interested, you can ask AI to explain the codes line by line /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/HKUworkshop/agent4hku/introduction_to_agent/scripts/batch_pdf_to_markdown.py
