Motivation
Often, researchers need to explore new scientific domains outside their field of expertise 
Getting a broad overview of an area of study is difficult due to the large number of relevant publications 
Literature reviews present a solution, but they might not always be available, may be too broad or too narrow in scope, and can be outdated quickly 
Related Work
Bibliometric analysis and literature review are essential tools for researchers 
Current tools and methods have limitations, such as being too broad or too narrow in scope, or being outdated quickly 
Method
We introduce litstudy, a Python package for literature reviews 
litstudy has a modular architecture, extensive functionality, and ease of use 
Five main features of litstudy: extracting metadata, filtering and selecting documents, computing statistics, generating bibliographic networks, and automatic topic discovery 
Method Details - Bibliographic Data Sources
litstudy supports several methods to retrieve metadata of scientific publications 
Unified interface allows data from different sources to be combined 
Method Details - Filtering
litstudy has functionality to filter, select, deduplicate, and annotate collections of documents 
This is essential for managing large datasets and ensuring data quality 
Method Details - Statistics
litstudy computes and plots general statistics on the metadata of the documents 
This includes statistics per year, per author, per journal, and other relevant metrics 
Method Details - Bibliographic Networks
litstudy generates, plots, and analyzes various bibliographic networks that reveal relations between publications and their authors 
This helps identify influential papers, authors, and research clusters 
Method Details - Natural Language Processing
litstudy enables automatic topic discovery based on natural language processing techniques 
This helps researchers identify key themes and trends in their research domain 
Experimental Method
We demonstrate the capabilities of litstudy through a comprehensive example 
This includes data collection, data cleaning and preprocessing, statistical analysis and visualization, network analysis, and topic modeling 
Experimental Setting
We used a dataset from multiple sources of scientific publications 
We varied various parameters for data cleaning, filtering, and analysis 
We used Python, the litstudy package, and Jupyter notebooks for the experiment 
Experimental Results
Our results show the effectiveness of litstudy in exploring a research domain 
litstudy successfully demonstrated its capabilities 
Ablation Experiment
We validated the role of key modules in litstudy through an ablation experiment 
Results show the importance of each module in the overall functionality of litstudy 
Deficiencies
Current methods and tools for literature review and bibliometric analysis have limitations 
litstudy addresses some of these limitations, but there is still room for improvement 
Future Research
Future work includes expanding the supported data sources 
Improving the NLP capabilities and enhancing the visualization features are also planned
