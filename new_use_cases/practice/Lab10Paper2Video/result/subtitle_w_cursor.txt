title page information | pointing to title
This is the title page of our talk, where we introduce our research paper on litstudy, a Python package for literature reviews.

###

Motivation is displayed on the top of the slide | pointing to "Motivation and Significance"
Our research was motivated by the need for researchers to explore new scientific domains outside their field of expertise. 
Getting a broad overview of an area of study is difficult due to the large number of relevant publications | moving cursor down item by item
Literature reviews present a solution, but they might not always be available, may be too broad or too narrow in scope, and can be outdated quickly | moving cursor to the last item.

###

Bibliometric analysis and literature review are displayed as the first item | pointing to the first item
Bibliometric analysis and literature review are essential tools for researchers. 
Current tools and methods have limitations, such as being too broad or too narrow in scope, or being outdated quickly | moving cursor down.

###

the method title is displayed on top of the slide | pointing to "Method"
We present litstudy, a Python package for literature reviews | pointing to the first item.
Our tool has a modular architecture, extensive functionality, and ease of use | moving cursor down item by item.
It consists of five main features, including data extraction, filtering, statistics computation, network analysis, and topic modeling | moving cursor to the second item of second itemize
The features allow users to manage large datasets, compute and plot statistics, analyze bibliographic networks, and discover topics | scrolling down in itemize.

###

our tool supports multiple data sources | pointing to "Supports several methods to retrieve metadata of scientific publications"
This slide explains that our tool supports multiple data sources to retrieve metadata of scientific publications, using a unified interface to combine them | moving cursor to the second item.

###

method title is displayed on top of the slide | pointing to "Method - Filtering"
Our tool also includes functionality to filter, select, deduplicate, and annotate collections of documents | pointing to the first item.
This functionality is essential for managing large datasets and ensuring data quality | moving cursor down.

###

Our tool allows users to compute and plot statistics, as displayed in the first item | pointing to the first item
This feature includes statistics per year, per author, per journal, and other relevant metrics | moving cursor down.

###

 bibligraphic networks are the main topic of this slide | pointing to "Generates, plots, and analyzes various bibliographic networks that reveal relations between publications and their authors"
Our tool helps researchers identify influential papers, authors, and research clusters by generating, plotting, and analyzing bibliographic networks | moving cursor to the second item.
These networks help reveal the structure of the research domain | moving cursor down.

###

automatic topic discovery is the main feature of this slide | pointing to "Enables automatic topic discovery based on natural language processing techniques"
Our tool enables automatic topic discovery using natural language processing techniques | moving cursor to the second item.
It helps researchers identify key themes and trends in their research domain | no.

###

experimental method is displayed on the top of the slide | pointing to "Experimental Method"
This comprehensive example demonstrates the capabilities of litstudy using real data from multiple sources | pointing to the first item.
Data collection, data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization, network analysis, and topic modeling are all covered in this example | no.

###

experimental setting has three main points | pointing to the first item
The experimental dataset consists of multiple sources of scientific publications | moving cursor down item by item.
Various parameters for data cleaning, filtering, and analysis were used | 
Our experiments were performed using Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment | moving cursor to the last item.

###

 experimental results are summarized on the top of the slide | pointing to the first item
Our experiments successfully demonstrate the capabilities of litstudy in exploring a research domain | moving cursor to the second item.
The results show the effectiveness of litstudy in identifying key themes and trends in the research domain | no.

###

 validation is displayed as the first item on the slide | pointing to the first item
This ablation experiment validates the role of key modules in litstudy | moving cursor down.
The results show the importance of each module in the overall functionality of litstudy | no.

###

deficiencies are mentioned on the top of the slide | pointing to "Limitations of current methods and tools for literature review and bibliometric analysis"
Our tool addresses some of the limitations of current methods and tools, such as being too broad or too narrow in scope, or being outdated quickly | moving cursor down.
However, there is still room for improvement in our tool, and we plan to expand its capabilities in the future | no.

###

future research is displayed on the top of the slide | pointing to "Expanding the supported data sources"
We plan to expand the data sources supported by litstudy in the future | moving cursor down item by item
Improving the natural language processing capabilities of our tool is another important direction for future research | 
Enhancing the visualization features will also improve the usability and effectiveness of litstudy | no.
