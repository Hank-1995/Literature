### Slide 2: Motivation

Often, researchers need to explore new scientific domains outside their field of expertise | cursor on first bullet point
Getting a broad overview of an area of study is difficult due to the large number of relevant publications | cursor on second bullet point
Literature reviews present a solution, but they might not always be available, may be too broad or too narrow in scope, and can be outdated quickly | cursor on third bullet point

### Slide 3: Related Work

Bibliometric analysis and literature review are essential tools for researchers | cursor on first bullet point
Current tools and methods have limitations, such as being too broad or too narrow in scope, or being outdated quickly | cursor on second bullet point

### Slide 4: Method

We introduce litstudy, a Python package for literature reviews | cursor on first bullet point
litstudy has a modular architecture, extensive functionality, and ease of use | cursor on second bullet point
Five main features of litstudy: extracting metadata, filtering and selecting documents, computing statistics, generating bibliographic networks, and automatic topic discovery | cursor on third bullet point

### Slide 5: Method Details - Bibliographic Data Sources

litstudy supports several methods to retrieve metadata of scientific publications | cursor on first bullet point
Unified interface allows data from different sources to be combined | cursor on second bullet point

### Slide 6: Method Details - Filtering

litstudy has functionality to filter, select, deduplicate, and annotate collections of documents | cursor on first bullet point
This is essential for managing large datasets and ensuring data quality | cursor on second bullet point

### Slide 7: Method Details - Statistics

litstudy computes and plots general statistics on the metadata of the documents | cursor on first bullet point
This includes statistics per year, per author, per journal, and other relevant metrics | cursor on second bullet point

### Slide 8: Method Details - Bibliographic Networks

litstudy generates, plots, and analyzes various bibliographic networks that reveal relations between publications and their authors | cursor on first bullet point
This helps identify influential papers, authors, and research clusters | cursor on second bullet point

### Slide 9: Method Details - Natural Language Processing

litstudy enables automatic topic discovery based on natural language processing techniques | cursor on first bullet point
This helps researchers identify key themes and trends in their research domain | cursor on second bullet point

### Slide 10: Experimental Method

We demonstrate the capabilities of litstudy through a comprehensive example | cursor on first bullet point
This includes data collection, data cleaning and preprocessing, statistical analysis and visualization, network analysis, and topic modeling | cursor on second bullet point

### Slide 11: Experimental Setting

We used a dataset from multiple sources of scientific publications | cursor on first bullet point
We varied various parameters for data cleaning, filtering, and analysis | cursor on second bullet point
We used Python, the litstudy package, and Jupyter notebooks for the experiment | cursor on third bullet point

### Slide 12: Experimental Results

Our results show the effectiveness of litstudy in exploring a research domain | cursor on first bullet point
litstudy successfully demonstrated its capabilities | cursor on second bullet point

### Slide 13: Ablation Experiment

We validated the role of key modules in litstudy through an ablation experiment | cursor on first bullet point
Results show the importance of each module in the overall functionality of litstudy | cursor on second bullet point

### Slide 14: Deficiencies

Current methods and tools for literature review and bibliometric analysis have limitations | cursor on first bullet point
litstudy addresses some of these limitations, but there is still room for improvement | cursor on second bullet point

### Slide 15: Future Research

Future work includes expanding the supported data sources | cursor on first bullet point
Improving the NLP capabilities and enhancing the visualization features are also planned | cursor on second and third bullet points
