I'll read the instruction.md file to understand what you're working on in the study5 agent workshop.


I can see you're working on analyzing AI literacy frameworks for English for Research Publication Purposes. Let me break this down into manageable sub-tasks and get started:


Now let me read all three papers to understand the AI literacy frameworks:


The files are quite large. Let me read them in smaller chunks to understand the content better. Let me start by reading the Cheng2025 paper first:


Let me continue reading the Cheng2025 paper to understand its framework:


Now let me search for the UNESCO framework content:


Let me search for the specific framework components in the UNESCO document:


Now let me update my progress and continue with the analysis:


**Status Report: Analysis Progress**
