# AI Literacy: A Comprehensive Analysis Based on Cheng2025 and Related Studies

## Overview

This note synthesizes findings from the Cheng2025 study and related AI literacy research to provide a comprehensive understanding of AI literacy frameworks, applications, and implications for L2 writing education.

## Key AI Literacy Frameworks

### 1. Warschauer et al.'s (2023) AI Literacy Framework

The foundational framework used in the Cheng2025 study consists of five steps:

1. **Understanding AI writing tools** - Fundamental aspects of ChatGPT, setup, and basic functionality
2. **Critical evaluation of AI-generated content** - Assessing accuracy, bias, and appropriateness
3. **Effective prompting strategies** - Crafting prompts for optimal AI responses
4. **Ethical considerations** - Academic integrity, plagiarism, and responsible use
5. **Integration with writing processes** - Incorporating AI tools into academic writing workflows

### 2. Wang and Wang's (2025) APSE Model for Critical AI Literacy (CAIL)

A more recent framework emphasizing critical perspectives:

- **A - Critical Awareness of AI**: Understanding AI capabilities, limitations, and implications
- **P - Critical Positionality**: Recognizing how cultural and academic backgrounds shape AI engagement
- **S - Critical Strategies**: Developing effective approaches for AI interaction
- **E - Critical Evaluation**: Assessing AI affordances and their impact on writing

## Key Findings from Cheng2025 Study

### Study Design
- **Participants**: Two ESL graduate students (Ian and Sam) in a higher education course
- **Method**: Case study with comprehensive AI literacy training
- **Data Sources**: Research paper drafts, ChatGPT chat histories, interviews
- **Analysis**: Coding of prompts, textual analysis, thematic analysis

### Main Findings

1. **Individualized Approaches**: Students developed distinct AI usage patterns reflecting their backgrounds
   - Ian: Selective use for specific assistance needs
   - Sam: Systematic engagement, particularly for APA style and coherence

2. **Genre Understanding**: Both participants effectively used ChatGPT for understanding academic genre conventions

3. **Academic Integrity**: Both approaches maintained scholarly voice and ethical standards

4. **Cultural Factors**: Educational and cultural backgrounds significantly influenced AI engagement patterns

## Critical AI Literacy Perspectives

### Darvin (2025): Critical Digital Literacies
- Emphasizes socio-political and cultural dimensions of AI use in L2 writing
- Highlights need for critical approaches beyond technical proficiency

### Ou et al. (2024): Critical GAI Literacy in Doctoral Writing
- Focuses on doctoral-level academic writing contexts
- Addresses power dynamics and critical evaluation of AI tools

- Cultural and educational contexts shape AI engagement patterns
- One-size-fits-all approaches are insufficient

### 2. Critical Perspectives
- Move beyond technical proficiency to critical evaluation
- Consider socio-political implications of AI use
- Address power dynamics in AI-assisted writing

### 3. Academic Integrity
- Maintaining scholarly voice while using AI tools
- Ethical considerations in AI-assisted writing
- Balance between assistance and authenticity

### 4. Genre Awareness
- AI tools can support genre understanding
- Need for discipline-specific AI literacy approaches
- Integration with existing writing pedagogy

## Implications for Practice
