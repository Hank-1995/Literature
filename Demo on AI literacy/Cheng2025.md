## Abstract

This [case study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/case-study "Learn more about case study from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") investigates how two ESL graduate students, Ian and Sam, use ChatGPT in their research writing after receiving a comprehensive tutorial based on Warschauer et al.’s (2023) AI literacy framework. We analyzed their engagement with ChatGPT across prompt categories including genre, content, language use, documentation, coherence, and clarity. Data were collected from research paper drafts, ChatGPT chat histories, and interviews. Data analyses included coding ChatGPT prompts, textual analysis of drafts, and thematic analysis of [interview transcripts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/interview-transcript "Learn more about interview transcripts from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Results show that while both participants utilized ChatGPT for understanding genre conventions and content development, they developed distinct approaches reflecting their individual backgrounds. Ian selectively used ChatGPT for specific assistance needs, while Sam engaged more systematically, particularly for APA style and coherence checks. Both approaches maintained academic integrity and scholarly voice, demonstrating that Generative AI tools can be effectively tailored to individual needs without compromising ethical standards. This study highlights how advanced ESL writers can adapt GenAI tools to their unique writing processes, offering insights into the diverse ways AI can enhance academic writing while preserving individual agency. The findings suggest that AI integration in academic writing can be customized to support diverse writing goals and backgrounds.

## 1. Introduction

In today’s globalized world, the academic demands on ESL graduate students in North American classrooms are ever-increasing. These students often encounter challenges in meeting the rigorous standards of academic writing. The complexity of mastering academic language, understanding cultural nuances, and adhering to established academic norms makes academic writing a daunting endeavor ([Angelova &amp; Riazantseva, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0001); [Sidman-Taveau &amp; Karathanos-Aguilar, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0022)). In their quest for assistance, students frequently turn to readily available artificial intelligence (AI)-driven tools, such as Microsoft’s auto-completion and Grammarly. Researchers have suggested that these AI tools, if used appropriately, may help to improve the clarity, efficiency, and overall quality of academic writing of L2 learners ([Praphan &amp; Praphan, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0020); [Sasaki, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0021); [Su et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0023); [Warschauer et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0027)).

One remarkable development in the world of AI-driven language tools is the advent of [Large Language Models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/large-language-model "Learn more about Large Language Models from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (LLMs), exemplified by OpenAI’s ChatGPT models. These LLMs have gained substantial popularity due to their ability to generate human-like responses by predicting what follows a given string of words using frequency data. What sets them apart from previous AI tools is their capacity to adapt their responses based on human feedback, a feature that holds immense promise for language learners and writers worldwide ([OpenAI, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0016)). For ESL students, Generative AI (GenAI) like ChatGPT offer both opportunities and challenges. Previous research has investigated the benefits and potential threats posed by AI tools in language instruction. These tools have been recognized as beneficial for nonnative English speakers ([Barrot, 2024a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0003); [Su et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0023)) and learners with special needs ([Lehner, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0013)), and they have also been acclaimed as efficient assistants for editing and summarizing completed work ([Casal &amp; Kessler, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0005)). However, these tools have simultaneously raised concerns related to the conventional definition of [plagiarism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/plagiarism "Learn more about plagiarism from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Su et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0023)) and elicited reservations about [educational equity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/educational-equity "Learn more about educational equity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Yan, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0028)). [Casal and Kessler (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0005) have also cautioned the potential for the improper use of AI chatbots to introduce biases and lead to data falsification. Recent scholarship has expanded the discourse on AI literacy, emphasizing the need for critical approaches that address cultural, ethical, and socio-political dimensions of AI use in L2 writing ([Darvin, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0007); [Ou et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0017); [Wang &amp; Wang, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0026)). These perspectives reveal how L2 writers’ backgrounds and academic experiences shape their engagement with AI, emphasizing the need to cultivate critical awareness and agency in AI-mediated writing practices.

Despite the burgeoning interest in AI chatbots and writing support tools, there remains a notable absence of empirical research regarding the impact of GenAI on students’ research writing development, particularly at the graduate level. According to [Barrot (2024b)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0004), skepticism still remains as students, instructors, and researchers at universities explore the use of GenAI tools for research writing. Recent studies have demonstrated that GenAI have the potential to significantly influence writing processes by enhancing various aspects, from conceptual planning and organization to language improvement and error correction ([Barrot, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0002); [Su et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0023)). Moreover, these tools have been shown to foster a more engaging and efficient writing experience for learners ([Wang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0025); [Yan, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0028)). However, most of these findings are based on undergraduate or general ESL/EFL contexts, leaving the significant impact on the complex task of graduate-level research writing largely unexplored. The unique challenges of ESL graduate writing, such as developing advanced [academic literacy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/academic-literacy "Learn more about academic literacy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Tardy, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0024)), recontextualizing genre awareness in research writing ([Cheng, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0006)), achieving fluent and idiomatic control of language ([Li et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0015)), and mastering specific linguistic features like rhetorical moves, citation forms and genre-specific language structures ([Li &amp; Flowerdew, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0014)), may interact differently with GenAI compared to simpler writing tasks. To address these challenges and ensure responsible AI integration in graduate-level research writing, this study implemented a comprehensive tutorial based on [Warschauer et al.’s (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0027) AI literacy framework. While [Warschauer et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0027) provided a foundational framework for understanding AI literacy, their study primarily focused on generic AI usage without addressing the nuanced needs of graduate-level research writing. Their framework did not provide detailed guidance on ethically and effectively integrating AI in high-stakes academic contexts where originality, voice, and scholarly rigor are paramount. This study extends their framework by incorporating specific strategies for graduate-level writing, including training on avoiding ambiguous citations and crafting effective research questions, tailored to the complexitites of research writing. Building on this foundation, this research invesgitates how ESL graduate students utilize ChatGPT in their research writing processes and their perceptions of its influence. By examining participants’ engagement with ChatGPT following structured training, this study aims to enhance understanding of how ESL writers can effectively integrate GenAI while maintaining scholarly standards and authentic voice.

## 2. Literature review

### 2.1. Generative AI and ChatGPT in academic writing

Recent developments in GenAI, particularly ChatGPT, have transformed the landscape of academic writing support. A [systematic review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/systematic-review "Learn more about systematic review from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") by [Yang and Li (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0029) revealed ChatGPT’s prevalent roles in content generation, feedback, and teaching support in L2 learning contexts, while highlighting the importance of context control and output customization. While earlier AI tools focused primarily on grammar checking and assessment, ChatGPT offers more compreheneisve assistance including content development, text modification, and language support ([Barrot, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0002)). For ESL writers specifically, these tools can potentially serve as equalizers in addressing linguistic disparities, though mastering their effective use requires considerable skill development ([Warschauer et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0027)).

The integration of GenAI in academic writing has raised important considerations about [plagiarism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/plagiarism "Learn more about plagiarism from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and ethical use. [Perkins (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0019) advocates for an “evolving social understanding of plagiarism” (p. 14), suggesting that transparent acknowledgement of AI use can address plagiarism concerns for ESL learners in higher education. This perspective has been supported by multiple scholars ([Kang &amp; Yi, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0011); [Kubota, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0012); [Pecorari, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0018); [Praphan &amp; Praphan, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0020); [Sasaki, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0021)) who unanimously recognize GenAI’s potential to facilitate ESL writers’ development while emphasizing the importance of ethical use.

Empirical studies examining ChatGPT’s impact on writing have revealed both opportunities and challenges. [Wang (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0025) found that first-year students effectively used ChatGPT for brainstorming, organization, and addressing both global issues (argument, structure, coherence) and local concerns (grammar and word choice) in argumentative writing. Similarly, [Su et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0023) demonstrated ChatGPT’s value across EFL argumentative writing stages, emphasizing the importance of reflection through documented interactions. However, these benefits exist in tension with potential drawbacks. [Yan (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0028) noted concerns among undergraduate EFL students that ChatGPT might reduce writing from a complex [cognitive process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/cognitive-process "Learn more about cognitive process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to mere “text-generation and post-editing” (p. 14). [Barrot (2024a)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0003) further questioned ChatGPT’s ability to capture authentic authorial voice—essential for ESL writers developing academic identity. This evidence suggest that while ChatGPT effectively scaffolds immediate writing tasks, its impact on deeper learning processes like critical thinking and voice development remains uncertain.

Research on ChatGPT-generated feedback shows promising results across diverse educational contexts. [Escalante et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0009) found no significant differences in learning outcomes between students receiving AI versus human tutor feedback. Their study of 91 English language learners revealed equal preference distribution between both feedback types, suggesting ChatGPT’s value as a complementary evaluation tool. Similarly, [Han and Li’s (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0010) study of 102 Chinese EFL undergraduate students demonstrated ChatGPT’s effectiveness in supporting teachers with feedback provision. Students successfully incorporated over 60 % of ChatGPT-supported feedback into their revisions, with notable improvements in word choice, sentence structure, and content development. This teacher-adapted feedback addressed both local concerns (grammar, punctuation) and global issues (coherence, organization). However, current research primarily focused on undergraduate students and does not adequately explore how advanced learners, particularly ESL graduate students, engage with ChatGPT for complex research writing tasks. This gap is significant given the higher cognitive and rhetorical demands of graduate-level writing, where maintaining scholarly voice and academic integrity remains crucial to success.

Recent scholarship has further emphasized the need for critical approaches to AI literacy that address the socio-political and cultural dimensions of AI use in L2 writing ([Darvin, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0007); [Ou et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0017); [Wang &amp; Wang, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0026)). [Wang and Wang (2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0026) proposed an APSE model for critical AI literacy (CAIL), which highlights four aspects: 1) critical awareness of AI (A); 2) critical positionality (P); 3) critical strategies for interacting with AI (S), and 4) critical evaluation of AI affordances (E). Their study illustrated how L2 writers’ cultural and academic backgrounds shaped their engagement with AI, revealing tensions between leveraging AI’s linguistic power and resisting its potential to reinforce standard [language ideologies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/language-ideology "Learn more about language ideologies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). [Ou et al.’s (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0017) study further contributed to this discourse by proposing a four-dimensional framework for critical AI (GAI) literacy in doctoral academic writing, encompassing interaction with GAI, GAI ethics, technical evaluation, and self-learning. Their findings demonstrated how doctoral students’ critical engagement with GenAI can foster metacognitive awareness and authorial agency, enabling them to navigate disciplinary-specific writing demands while interrogating AI’s limitations and biases. This aligns with [Warschauer et al.’s (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0027) AI literary framework, which includes five key components: understanding AI tools’ fundamental aspects, developing task-specific utilization skills, mastering effective prompting strategies, verifying AI-generated content, and ethically integrating and documenting AI use. Together, the above-mentioned frameworks suggest that fostering critical AI literacy involves not only technical skills but also reflective practices that empower L2 writers to negotiate their multilingual identities and resist AI’s potential to homogenize academic discourse.

### 2.2. ESL graduate research writing and ChatGPT

The critical perspectives on AI literacy become particularly relevant when examining the unique challenges faced by ESL graduate students in research writing contexts. Research on ESL graduate students’ research writing emphasizes the complex interplay of genre awareness, rhetorical knowledge, and language proficiency, all of which are critical for success in advanced [academic literacy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/academic-literacy "Learn more about academic literacy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). [Tardy (2005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0024) highlights the importance of rhetorical knowledge, arguing that ESL students must not only understand disciplinary ideologies but also transition from knowledge transmission to knowledge construction. This transition requires a deep understanding of how rhetorical strategies shape academic arguments and communicate disciplilnary knowledge. Building on this, [Cheng (2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0006) stressed the need for [genre analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/genre-analysis "Learn more about genre analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and [recontextualization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/recontextualization "Learn more about recontextualization from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of genre awareness in research writing, emphasizing that ESL students must learn to adapt genre conventions to achieve specific communicative goals within their disciplines. However, as [Li et al. (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0015) pointed out, teaching genre and rhetorical knowledge alone is insufficient; ESL graduate students also need explicit language instruction to develop fluent and idiomatic language control in research writing. [Li and Flowerdew (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0014) further identified key linguistic features crucial for research writing, including rhetorical moves, citation forms, and genre-specific language structures. They advocated for implicit teaching methods to foster students’ independence in navigating research writing complexities. Collectively, these studies highlighted the need for a holistic approach to teach research writing to ESL graduate students, integrating genre awareness, rhetorical conventions and linguistic skills.

In this context, AI chatbots like ChatGPT present a promising avenue for addressing these multifacted challenges. ChatGPT can serve as a valulable tool for enhancing ESL graduate students’ genre awareness and rhetorical knowledge by providing immediate access to disciplinary-specific genre conventions and rhetorical structures. For example, students can prompt ChatGPT to generate examples of different sections of a research paper, such as abstracts, introductions and literature reviews, and then analyze the structural and linguistic features of these examples. This approach aligns with [Cheng’s (2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0006) recommendations for genre analysis, allowing students to deconstruct and reconstruct genre conventions in ways that are meaningful for their disciplilnary contexts. Moreover, ChatGPT could assist in developing rhetorical knowledge by generating multiple versions of the same content with varying rhetorical strategies. This capability enables students to compare how different rhetorical approaches impact the effectiveness of an academic argument, cultivating critical thinking and a deeper understanding of rhetorical choices ([Tardy, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0024)). However, while ChatGPT offers significant potential for enhancing genre and rhetorical awareness, it is not a substitute for explicit language instruction. As [Li et al. (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0015) cautioned, students must also develop the linguistic competency necessary for independent research writing. The key lies in leveraging ChatGPT not as a replacement for traditional research writing instruction, but as a complementary tool that enhances students’ awareness and critical thinking about genre, rhetorical, and language choices in their research writing process. This perspective aligns with the need for a holistic approach to supporting ESL graduate students in their research writing development.

While existing literature provides valuable insights into both GenAI in writing instruction and the complexities of ESL graduate research writing, several critical gaps emerge at their intersection. First, while studies have examined ChatGPT’s use in undergraduate and general ESL/EFL contexts (e.g., [Wang, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0025); [Yan, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0028)), there remains limited empirical investigation of how ESL graduate students—who face unique challenges in research writing—integrate this tool into their writing processes. Second, although research has established the importance of genre awareness, rhetorical knowledge, and language proficiency in graduate research writing ([Tardy, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0024); [Li &amp; Flowerdew, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0014)), we have yet to understand how GenAI might support these specific aspects of advanced academic literacy. Third, while [Warschauer et al.’s (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0027) AI literacy framework offers promising guidance for ethical AI integration, its application in graduate research writing contexts remains unexplored.

The current study addresses these gaps by investigating how ESL graduate students engage with ChatGPT in their research writing processes. Understanding how ESL graduate students utilize ChatGPT’s capabilities while maintaining their scholarly voice and academic integrity can provide crucial insights for developing effective pedagogical approaches and ethical guidelines for AI integration in graduate-level writing instruction.

The study is guided by the following three research questions:* **1)**How do ESL graduate students engage with ChatGPT during their research writing?

* **2)**How do ESL graduate students incorporate ChatGPT output in their research papers?
* **3)**What are ESL graduate students’ perceptions of using ChatGPT for research writing?

## 3. Method

This study adopts a qualitative [case study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/case-study "Learn more about case study from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") approach to describe how ESL graduate students utilize ChatGPT for their writing of research papers and their emic perspectives. According to [Yin (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0030), a descriptive case study aims to provide an in-depth and contextualized portrayal of a specific phenomenon. The goal of this approach is to reach a deep understanding of a specific case, to enhance the context in which the case occurs, and to extend to other similar cases. Our study focuses on two cases purposely selected based on two key criteria: 1) participants must be speaking English as a second language (ESL), and 2) participants must be enrolled in an online graduate program. These criteria were established to address the limited support graduate ESL students often receive in online programs, particularly in research writing. By investigating participants who exhibit contrasting ChatGPT usage patterns, this study can highlight individual factors that influence the adoption and application of AI writing tools. This comparative approach allows for a more detailed understanding of how personal preferences, [prior experiences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/prior-experience "Learn more about prior experiences from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), or other individual characteristics may shape the integration of ChatGPT in research writing processes.

### 3.1. Participants and context

The two featured ESL graduate students are Ian and Sam. At the time of the data collection (Spring 2024), both were first-year doctoral students in an EdD program in Higher Education at a public institution in the Southwest of U.S. Originally from Bangladesh, Ian (pseudonym) has been in the U.S. for 2.5 years. He is fluent in Bengali and English, with some proficiency in spoken Hindi. His previous education in Bangladesh was conducted in English, although the instructional approach was heavily focused on rote memorization rather than communicative methods. Ian holds a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Business Administration from a prestigious university in Bangladesh. He has extensive experience in English research paper writing. He reported that his previous research writing were primarily business proposals, and he has also done an empirical research paper on technology in business. He has observed that writing in the U.S. emphasizes a more polished and etiquette-driven style compared to his experiences back home. Sam (pseudonym), originally from Nepal, has been living in the U.S. for nine years. Sam speaks Nepali and English fluently, with limited conversational ability in Hindi. Sam’s English education began in high school in Nepal, where content area subjects were taught in English. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in Communications and dual Master’s degrees in Communication and [Business Analytics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/business-analytics "Learn more about Business Analytics from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), all from U.S. institutions. Sam’s experience with English research writing started during his undergraduate studies. He reported that he learned to write literature reviews, develop research questions, and utilize library databases to identify sources in the interview. Both participants reported using ChatGPT in their personal writing (e.g., emails) and in brainstorming ideas and polishing language use in academic writing.

The course Ian and Sam registered for during the data collection of this study was a 15-week online course, titled History of Higher Education in the U.S. This is a core course offered in their EdD program where the third author works. According to the course syllabus, this course provides a comprehensive exploration of the origin, development, and distinctive characteristics of higher education in the U.S. Students in this course are expected to be active, self-directed learners and practice research writing skills including drafting, editing, and citing accurately according to the requirements of the APA style manual. The course syllabus also includes the AI use policy from the institution, which states that the university permits the use of AI tools, such as ChatBots, for generating or suggesting text when explicitly allowed by the course instructor. Students are required to document the use of AI tools, and failing to do so is considered plagiarism. Students are ultimately responsible for the content they submit, including any instances of plagiarism or [misrepresentation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/misrepresentation "Learn more about misrepresentation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") by AI. Both students were granted permissions from the course instructor[^2^](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#cit_1) to use ChatGPT in writing their research papers in this course.

### 3.2. Research writing assignment and training

The research writing assignment the participants completed in their course was a historical research project. This was the final project that requires students to explore a historical topic in higher education of their choice. The project is divided into three parts: First, a detailed examination of the chosen topic’s history; second, an analysis connecting the historical context to contemporary issues and projecting future implications; and third, a comprehensive write-up integrating the first two parts while discussing the practical implications for scholars, practitioners, and students. Each part is worth 20 points and limits to 5–7 pages. While the first two parts were due at the beginning and the middle of the semester, the entire paper (including all three parts) was due at the end of the semester. Students were encouraged to select topics that align with their interests or professional relevance. Ian chose to focus on the history of [educational technology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/educational-technology "Learn more about educational technology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in higher education for his paper, and Sam focused on the evolution of [enterprise](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/company "Learn more about enterprise from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") resource planning in higher education.

To support students who were considering of using GenAI in their research writing, this study began with offering a training session to the participants on responsible AI use. Based on previous research on ChatGPT and research writing, a comprehensive tutorial[^3^](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#cit_2) containing 24 slides and a reference page with additional resources was developed by the research team. The tutorial follows the five steps of the AI literacy framework outlined by [Warschauer et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0027). The content was tailored to address the unique needs of ESL graduate students like Ian and Sam, who face challenges in research writing, such as navigating academic conventions in English and adapting to the expectations of U.S. academic writing styles. The first step, understanding AI writing tools, introduces fundamental aspects of ChatGPT, such as setting up access, navigating the interface, and understanding its capabilities and limitations. By clarifying ChatGPT’s strengths and weaknesses, the tutorial helped the participants approach the tool with realistic expectations. The second step, utilizing AI for specific communication tasks, provided examples of how to use ChatGPT for research writing tasks, such as brainstorming search terms, revising for coherence, and editing in-text citations. These tasks were designed to address the participats’ reported challenges in brainstorming ideas, organizing a research paper, documenting sources and polishing language use. Moreover, the tutorial included specific information on the research paper genre, such as avoiding ambiguous citations, improving the quality of the research questions, and evaluating the quality of a research paper. The third step, skillfully prompting AI, emphasizes the importance of writing clear prompts and includes strategies for hypothesizing responses and adapting questions when needed. These strategies were tailored to help participants like Ian and Sam, who were already using ChatGPT in personal writing, transition to more sophisticated academic applications. The fourth step, verifying AI-generated content, taught students to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated content by cross-verifying with other sources. This step was critical for both participants, given the historical nature of their research projects, which required accurate and well-documented information. Ian’s project on the history of educational technology and Sam’s focus on the evolution of enterprise resource planning both demanded rigorous fact-checking, which the tutorial emphasized as a key component of responsible AI use. The fifth step, ethically integrating AI into writing, addressed ethical considerations, such as avoiding plagiarism by providing proper attributions when using AI-generated content. This step was particularly crucial for Ian and Sam, given their institution’s AI use policy, which required documentation of AI tool usage. The tutorial also advised on effectively incorporating AI outputs into one’s own writing while maintaining academic integrity, a skill both participants needed to acquire to be successful in their Ed.D. program. The training materials advocate an ongoing learning process, encouraging students to continually refine their interactions with ChatGPT ([Dougall, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0008)). Participants were explicitly informed that the tutorial’s purpose was educational rather than prescriptive—they were neither encouraged nor discouraged from using ChatGPT in their research writing. Instead, the training aimed to equip them with necessary technical proficiency and critical awareness should they decide to incorporate ChatGPT in their writing process. This neutral stance was maintained throughout the study to minimize any potential influence on participants’ natural writing behaviors and choices regarding AI use. By addressing the specific challenges and goals of ESL graduate students in online programs, the tutorial provided a tailored foundation for participants to explore the potential of ChatGPT in their research writing.

### 3.3. Data collection and analysis

The study was conducted in the following steps: First, the first author obtained informed consent signatures from participants and held online training sessions with them during the first two weeks of Spring 2024. In the subsequent ten weeks, the participants completed their course-related research writing assignments with the assistance of ChatGPT. At the end of the semester, they shared their research paper assignments, research paper drafts, and chat histories with ChatGPT with the first author, a faculty member outside of their academic department, via emails. During the week after the participants submitted their final projects, the first author arranged an individual interview with each of them via Zoom to collect perception data. These interviews were semi-structured, conducted in English, with flexibility to probe deeper with follow-up questions, reorder questions, or combine them to suit the specific context of each participant (See Appendix A for the interview protocol.). To analyze the triangulated data sources, we addressed each of the three research questions systematically. To ensure coding reliability, a second coder was involved in each phase of the analysis, and inter-coder agreement was established through iterative discussions and consensus-building to resolve any discrepancies.

#### 3.3.1. Analysis of RQ1

To address the first research question on the ways in which ESL graduate students engaged with ChatGPT in research writing, the prompts used by participants in their interactions with ChatGPT during research paper writing were compiled into Excel spreadsheets for analysis. The following six themes were identified by the first author and confirmed by the other two authors: content, clarity, coherence, documentation, genre, and language use. Afterwards, 20 % of the data was analyzed by the second author, reaching the inter-coder agreement of 90.48 %, with disagreements resolved upon discussions.

Specifically, the researchers conducted a thematic analysis of the collected data. [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#tbl0001) presents a comprehensive overview of the categories and subcategroies of ChatGPT prompts identified in our study. This table summarizes the various types of assistance sought by participants during their research writing process, ranging from content development to language refinement. The prompts were classified into six main categories: content, clarity, coherence, documentation, genre, and language use. Each category was further divided into subcategories to provide a more nuanced understanding of the specific areas where participants used AI assistance. For example, the content category includes prompts related to brainstorming, drafting, and revising, reflecting the different stages of the writing process. Examples are provided in each subcategory to illustrate the nature of the prompts used by participants.

When multiple consecutive prompts fell into the same category, only one occurrence of the category was counted. For instance, Sam asked ChatGPT to check his references in the research paper through multiple, consecutive, refined prompts, such as: *1) I will give you the list of references. Arrange it alphabetically. 2) Are there any duplications? 3) Did you miss anything? 4) There were 45 in the list. And you only listed 40. 5) Remove numbering from my references. 6) I need all of them, alphabetically ordered, without any duplicates.* These prompts were all related to the same inquiry about the APA style of the reference list in his research paper, so only one occurrence of the category, “documentation” was recorded.

#### 3.3.2. Analysis of RQ2

To address the second research question on how ESL graduate students incorporated ChatGPT output in research writing, the researchers conducted a close textual analysis of the participants’ research paper drafts by comparing them with the corresponding chat histories. The first author completed the coding independently. An occurrence of adoption was recorded in a spreadsheet when a participant fully or partially incorporated suggestions from the chat histories following a specific prompt. The study did not distinguish between full and partial incoporations because ChatGPT often provides complex, multi-faceted responses that include explanations, examples, and suggestions, making it challenging to categorize incoporations as strictly “full” or “partial.” By focusing on whether incorporation occurred, rather than its extent, we were able to maintain higher inter-rater reliability and consistency in our coding process. The third author coded 20 % of the entire data and reached full agreement. The percentages of adoption in each of six previously identified categories (i.e., content, clarity, coherence, documentation, genre, and language use) and overall adoption rates were calculated for each participant. (Excerpt 1)

**Excerpt 1**An example of adoption from ChatGPT chat history

![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S8755461525000210-fx1.jpg)

In this example, the participant, Sam, asked ChatGPT to revise his heading and clarified the ideas he wanted to express. He developed his own revision based on two suggestions provided by ChatGPT, which ChatGPT confirmed. The code “adopt” was assigned to the case, as the final adoption was achieved through close collaboration between the participant and ChatGPT.

#### 3.3.3. Analysis of RQ3

To address the third research question on ESL graduate students’ perceptions of using ChatGPT in research writing, interview data from both participants was audio recorded and analyzed. The first author conducted content analysis using an open coding approach. This involved an initial, unbiased examination of the [interview transcripts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/interview-transcript "Learn more about interview transcripts from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), where the data was analyzed without preconceived categories, allowing themes to naturally emerge. These themes included participants’ perceptions of using ChatGPT in different writing stages (i.e., brainstorming, drafting, revising and editing) as well as overall perceptions on the advantages and disadvantages of using ChatGPT. The other two authors verified the themes by closely reviewing the interview transcripts from each of the two participants, respectively.

## 4. Results

### 4.1. Patterns of ChatGPT usage in ESL graduate students’ research writing

The first research question explored how ESL graduate students use ChatGPT in their research writing. The findings, as shown in [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#tbl0002), revealed distinct usage patterns between Ian and Sam. Sam engaged with ChatGPT more frequently than Ian, with a total of 138 prompt categories, in sharp contrast to Ian’s 21 instances. For Ian, the top three categories of usage were genre, content, and language use. In contrast, although Sam used ChatGPT more frequently in these categories, his predominant usage was on documentation, coherence, and clarity.

**Table 2**. Categories of ChatGPT prompts used by ESL graduate students.

| Category      | Ian           | Sam            |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Content       | 5 (23.81 %)   | 21 (15.22 %)   |
| Clarity       | 2 (9.52 %)    | 25 (18.12 %)   |
| Coherence     | 2 (9.52 %)    | 29 (21.01 %)   |
| Documentation | 2 (9.52 %)    | 47 (34.06 %)   |
| Genre         | 6 (28.57 %)   | 6 (4.35 %)     |
| Language Use  | 4 (19.05 %)   | 10 (7.25 %)    |
| Total         | 21 (100.00 %) | 138 (100.00 %) |

Both participants used ChatGPT to inquire about the research paper genre. These inquiries included a wide array of questions that varied from general structural concerns to more nuanced queries about specific sections of a research paper. For instance, Ian sought guidance on fundamental aspects of writing a research paper, such as “ *Can you give me a structure of a typical research paper?* ” and more targeted advice like “ *How to write a good literature review?* ” Similarly, Sam’s prompts included both general and specific aspects of research writing, including requests for an outline of an abstract on his chosen research topic (i.e., *the evolution of **[enterprise](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/company "Learn more about enterprise from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")** resource planning in higher education*) and more technical questions like “ *Can an abstract be more than one page?* ” These examples illustrate the participants’ need for clear guidance on the conventions and organization of research papers, highlighting genre’s role as a critical area of support in their academic writing process.

As another commonly inquired category of prompt, content demonstrates how ESL graduate students engaged with various stages of the writing process. This category includes inquiries ranging from brainstorming potential research topics to revising existing text. For example, Ian’s prompts revealed a need for assistance in exploring topic ideas, as seen in his request for “ *a few research topic options on the history of technology in higher education* .” Additionally, Ian requested help in expanding his ideas, asking ChatGPT to “ *elaborate* ” on how technology has transformed learning in higher education. Sam’s prompts, on the other hand, reflected a broader scope of content-related inquiries, including requests for definitions and explanations of complex concepts like “ *three-tier-architecture, web-based architecture, service-oriented-architecture in higher education* .” Sam also asked ChatGPT to generate specific content such as headings, abstract creation, and refining his written work. These examples showed how inquiring in the content category with ChatGPT served as a critical support mechanism for ESL graduate students, aiding them at various stages of their writing process from ideation to revision.

The category of language use was reflected in participants’ requests for assistance with grammar, vocabulary, and paraphrasing. These prompts highlight their need for support in refining their language to meet academic standards. For example, Ian’s prompts included direct requests like “ *Can you check grammar in the following paragraph?* ” and “ *Can you paraphrase it* ” which involved providing a text and asking for rephrasing. Similarly, Sam asked for help to revise different parts of his paper, such as subheadings and abstract. Sam’s prompts on language use also intersected with other categories such as documentation and clarity, e.g., “ *Revise my abstract for grammar, abstract word requirement and readability* .” These examples demonstrated how ESL graduate students used language-related prompts in ChatGPT to enhance the quality and precision of their written work.

The category of documentation pertains to prompts focused on adhering to APA style guidelines, including formatting for headings, in-text citations, and references. This was the most frequently used category in Sam’s interactions with ChatGPT (47 occurences and 34.06 %). Sam’s prompts included requests such as “ *Follow APA style. Include citation in a sentence* ,” which indicated his concern for proper citation practices. He also asked help in formatting references (e.g., “*Are both of these correct for APA 7th edition: First Inistials. LastName (Year) writes: OR LastName, Frist Initials. (Year) writes:”)* and inquired about specific rules like the use of “et al.” and the correct order of references (e.g., “ *I need all of them, alphabetically ordered, without any duplicates* .”). Additionally, Sam used prompts to address more complex citation scenarios, such as citing secondary sources, as reflected in his question, “ *It has a phrase that I want to cite, but that phrase is cited. Which in-text citation should I put?* ” His meticulous approach to ensuring accuracy and compliance with APA standards was further exemplified by his use of ChatGPT to review and correct multiple components of his research paper draft, with explicit instructions to “ *follow APA 7th style guidelines.* ” These examples illustrated the importance of documentation as a critical area where graduate students like Sam relied on ChatGPT for precise academic support.

The other two top categories of prompts employed by Sam were coherence and clarity. Prompts related to coherence centered on ensuring the logical flow and organization of ideas within the research writing. In all 27 instances (21.01 %) where Sam checked for coherence, he used a prompt modeled from the training session, followed by specific requests for ChatGPT to identify and resolve coherence issues in his text. Prompts related to clarity focused on participants seeking evaluations of whether their writing was clear and free of ambiguities. Sam often used prompts like “ *Evaluate the following text to identify if there are any ambiguities,* ” followed by requests for ChatGPT to “ *Fix it for me please* ” or to explain, “ *What did you fix?* ” The clarity category frequently overlapped with other categories, co-occurring with documentation four times, with both language use and documentation twice, and with both coherence and documentation 19 times.

### 4.2. Integration of ChatGPT output in ESL graduate students’ research writing

Research Question Two asked how ESL graduate students incorporated ChatGPT output into their research papers. The data presented in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#fig0001) illustrate the percentages of adoption across six previously identified categories: content, clarity, coherence, documentation, genre, and language use. Additionally, the overall adoption rate for each participant was calculated.

**Fig. 1**. Percentages of adoption of ChatGPT suggestions in ESL graduate students’ research writing.

Overall, the results indicated that Sam demonstrated a higher rate of adoption of ChatGPT suggestions compared to Ian. Specifically, Sam showed greater integration in the categories of clarity, coherence, and language use. In contrast, Ian’s higher adoption rates were observed in the content and documentation categories, although these instances were limited (i.e., three occurrences in content and two in documentation).

Sam frequently relied on ChatGPT to enhance the clarity of his research writing. For example, in one instance, Sam asked it to “ *evaluate the following text to identify if there are any ambiguities* ,” (See Excerpt 2) followed by a request to “ *fix it for me please* .”

**Excerpt 2**Sam’s original text entered in ChatGPT’s prompt

![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S8755461525000210-fx2.jpg)

ChatGPT identified three points of ambiguities and proposed a revision plan (See Excerpt 3). The subsequent output from ChatGPT incorporated two of the three suggested revisions, as indicated by the highlighted sections in the output (See Excerpt 4). Sam adopted the revised text verbatim in his final research paper.

**Excerpt 3**ChatGPT’s detections of ambiguities and corresponding revision plan

Words in the red squares are the changes made in ChatGPT’s revised text.

Although ChatGPT occasionally identified coherence issues and offered corresponding revision plans, these suggestions were not always reflected in the final output. For instance, when Sam requested feedback on the coherence of the text shown in the previous example, ChatGPT detected two coherence breaks and outlined a revision plan (See Excerpt 5). However, neither of these revisions was implemented in the revised text provided by ChatGPT (See Excerpt 4).

**Excerpt 5**ChatGPT’s detections of coherence breaks and corresponding revision plan

![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S8755461525000210-fx5.jpg)

Sam also utilized ChatGPT for refining language use in his paper. One notable example involved his requests for ChatGPT to revise his subheadings, such as “ *Current Landscape of ERP in Higher Education* .” ChatGPT’s suggestion, “*Contemporary Trends in ERP for Higher Education,”* was fully adopted by Sam.

Despite ChatGPT provided useful suggestions to the participants, both participants displayed a tendency to only partially adopt content-related suggestions from ChatGPT. For example, Ian requested ChatGPT to “ *elaborate* ” on a paragraph he drafted, which began with the sentences: “ *Technology has dramatically changed how we learn in higher education colleges and universities. Online classes are becoming more and more common, instead of just having in-person classes* .” While ChatGPT generated an extended paragraph in response (Excerpt 6), Ian incorporated two sentences from this output verbatim into his paper (see highlights in Excerpt 7), with the remaining content written in his own words.

### 4.3. ESL graduate students’ perceptions of using ChatGPT in research writing

Research Question Three asked about participants’ perceptions of using ChatGPT in research writing. Analysis of the interview data revealed themes on brainstorming, drafting, revising and editing, and overall perceptions.

Both participants reported that they used ChatGPT for research brainstorming, but with different approaches. Ian used it to generate topic suggestions and structure ideas for his paper, but he was cautious about directly adopting these ideas due to plagiarism concerns. He explained that he typically took some of the suggestions offered by ChatGPT and combined with his own ideas so that his writing is not identical to the revised version in ChatGPT output. Sam used ChatGPT to narrow down his research topic, and once he decided on his topic, he then used ChatGPT to generate a list of options for expanding his research paper.

During the drafting process, both participants reported that they integrated ChatGPT with other tools. Ian used ChatGPT to summarize content from websites, rephrasing the output to avoid direct adoption. He found ChatGPT useful for summarizing complex information quickly, stating, “*It reduces your writing time, I would say 50*  *%, because you don’t have to read 4, 5 or 10 pages* .” On the other hand, Sam used ChatGPT as a supplementary tool to clarify concepts and terminology. He said, “ *It really felt it is like a tutor, you know, like it’s just someone there to help me understand the key terminology* .” However, Sam also expressed frustration with ChatGPT’s limitations, particularly its inability to evaluate an entire paper due to word restrictions.

Regarding using ChatGPT for revising and editing tasks, Ian was cautious, preferring to rely on his own judgment and that of a second reader rather than incorporating all ChatGPT’s feedback. He emphasized the importance of personal input in the revision process. Sam reported using ChatGPT more extensively for editing, particularly for checking references and grammar. He viewed ChatGPT as a valuable tool for enhancing his writing but stressed the need for human oversight: “ *I definitely use it as a tool but not completely rely on it. It is just an addition of the research tools that students like me benefit from* .”

When asked about their overall perceptions, both participants recognized the advantages of using ChatGPT in terms of efficiency and access to knowledge. Ian appreciated ChatGPT for its quick, accurate responses, particularly in structuring his writing and generating ideas. However, he was wary of over-reliance on the tool, acknowledging the risks of not thinking creatively: “*You have to use it in a way that does not harm you. Yeah, you cannot rely on it 100*  *%. No, not at all* .” Similarly, Sam showed his appreciation on ChatGPT’s role in providing timely information and reducing the burden of asking potentially “ *silly* ” questions to a human instructor: “ *I don’t need to worry about losing face in front of a human instructor* .”

In summary, the interview data revealed that while both Ian and Sam found ChatGPT to be a helpful tool in various stages of their research writing, they remained cautious about its limitations and potential drawbacks. They emphasized the importance of using ChatGPT as a supplementary resource rather than a replacement for critical thinking and personal input.

## 5. Discussion

This study explored how ESL graduate students use ChatGPT in their research writing, revealing patterns that align with and extend [Warschauer et al.’s (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0027) AI literacy framework. The findings demonstrated how ESL graduate students integrated GenAI into their research writing processes, offering insights into how the AI literacy framework can be adapted to the rigorous demands of academic scholarship. Recent work on critical AI literacy ([Darvin, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0007); [Ou et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0017); [Wang &amp; Wang, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0026)) further validates the importance of contextual factors observed in our participants’ AI engagement, particularly the socio-political and cultural dimensions of AI use in L2 writing.

Both Ian and Sam demonstrated strong understanding of AI writing tools (Step 1 of AI literacy framework), using ChatGPT as a resource to navigate the complexities of research paper writing, particularly in understanding genre conventions. This finding aligns with [Tardy’s (2005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0024) emphasis on the importance of rhetorical knowledge in developing advanced academic literacy. However, their approaches to genre understanding were influenced by their distinct educational and cultural backgrounds, echoing [Wang and Wang’s (2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0026) APSE model, which highlights the role of critical positionality (P) in shaping L2 writers’ engagement with AI. Ian, with his extensive experience in business proposal writing in Bangladesh, approached academic writing with a focus on structure and clarity, reflecting the more formal and directive writing style he was accustomed to. In contrast, given his nine years’ schooling experiences in the U.S., Sam’s familiarity with the U.S. academic context allowed him to engage more fluidly with ChatGPT to explore and refine his ideas, reflecting a deeper integration of genre awareness into his writing process. These findings extended the AI literacy framework by highlighting the importance of contextual and cultural factors in shaping how ESL scholars understanding and use GenAI in the demanding environment of academic research.

The participants effectively utilized GenAI for specific communication tasks (Step 2 of AI literacy framework), evident in their content-related prompts for brainstorming topics to expanding ideas. This resonates with [Cheng’s (2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0006) argument on the necessity of recontextualizing genre awareness in research writing. However, their approaches to content development were also shaped by their [prior experiences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/prior-experience "Learn more about prior experiences from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), reflecting the “critical strategies for interacting with AI” (S) dimension in [Wang and Wang’s (2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0026) APSE model. Ian’s background in business administration and his experience with empirical research in Bangladesh led him to use ChatGPT primarily for exploring topic ideas, reflecting his preference for a more systematic approach to writing. Sam leveraged his dual Master’s degrees to engage more creatively with ChatGPT, using it to both explore topics and refine specific arguments. These findings extended the AI literacy framework by highlighting task-specific GenAI strategies tied to students’ academic backgrounds, aligning with [Ou et al.’s (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0017) emphasis on self-regulated learning and metacognitive awareness in critical AI literacy.

The participants’ skillful prompting abilities (Step 3 of AI literacy framework) were demonstrated through their requests for language support, highlighting the critical role of language proficiency in effective research writing ([Li et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0015)). Sam’s systematic use of ChatGPT for APA style compliance and coherence checks reflects his extensive experience with U.S. academic writing conventions. His repeated prompting and careful evaluation of AI outputs exemplify strong verification practices (Step 4 of AI literacy framework), indicating high metacognitive awareness that parallels the “critical evaluation of AI affordances” (E) dimension in [Wang and Wang’s (2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0026) APSE model. Ian’s more selective use of ChatGPT for language refinement may reflect his transition from a different academic culture, where emphasis on polished writing was less prounounced.

The findings illustrate distinct approaches to ethically integrate AI (Step 5 of AI literacy framework). Sam’s extensive use of ChatGPT, coupled with his critical evaluation of prompts, suggests deep cognitive engagement with the writing process. His approach demonstrates how GenAI can serve as a tool for iterative learning and knowledge construction, as advocated by [Ou et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0017), who emphasized the need for L2 writers to develop authorial agency and text ownership in GenAI-mediated writing. Ian’s more selective use reflects his adaptation to the U.S. academic context, where concerns about plagiarism and ethical AI use are prominent. This resonates with [Wang and Wang’s (2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0026) caution about the potential for AI to reinforce standard [language ideologies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/language-ideology "Learn more about language ideologies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and marginalize non-dominant literacies.

The findings highlight the importance of considering individual contexts and experiences in understanding AI tool usage across all five steps of the AI literacy framework. Both participants’ high English proficiency levels and extensive experience in English-medium education position them as skilled ESL writers rather than traditional L2 learners. However, their differing approaches to ChatGPT reflect not just language proficiency but also their understanding of academic conventions given their different backgrounds. For broader applications, these findings emphasize the need for tailored support for ESL scholars, considering their diverse backgrounds and cultural contexts. Effective AI integration in academic writing depends not on frequency of use but on thoughtful application of AI literacy skills, including critical evaluation, selective implementation, and transparent documentation. By recognizing the unique ways in which ESL scholars engage with GenAI, educators can develop more effective strategies for integrating AI into academic writing instruction and enhance the writing experiences and outcomes of ESL graduate students.

## 6. Conclusion

This study has provided valuable insights into the ways in which ESL graduate students use ChatGPT in research paper writing. The findings demonstrate that both Ian and Sam leveraged ChatGPT strategically for understanding genre conventions, content development, language refinement, documentation checking, and coherence and clarity improvement, though their approaches differed in ways that reflected their individual backgrounds and writing strategies.

This study contributes significantly to the field of L2 writing and [educational technology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/educational-technology "Learn more about educational technology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") by highlighting the nuanced ways in which GenAI like ChatGPT can influence research writing practices. By examining the distinct usage patterns of Ian and Sam, the study provides a deeper understanding of how different levels of AI reliance can impact advanced L2 students’ research writing processes and outcomes. The findings offer practical implications for educators in designing AI-integrated writing tasks in disciplinary writing classrooms. These tasks should support the development of research genre awareness, disciplinary content knowledge, and academic language while acknowledging and validating different approaches to AI integration.

The study’s findings suggest several key pedagogical implications. First, educators should integrate AI literacy into academic curricula to help students understand GenAI tools’ functions, strengths and limitations. As [Warschauer et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0027) highlight, effective AI [literacy programs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/literacy-programmes "Learn more about literacy programs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") can enhance students’ ability to use AI tools responsibly and effectively, fostering a deeper understanding of technology and its role in academic writing. Secondly, instruction should focus on helping students develop their own informed approaches to AI integration that align with their writing goals and preferences. Rather than prescribing specific levels of AI use, educators can guide students in developing strategic approaches that complement their existing writing processes while preserving their own authorial voice. Thirdly, implementing reflective practices where students assess their use of GenAI can support a better understanding of the ethical implications and potential impacts on their learning. [Perkins (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461525000210#bib0019) emphasizes the need for transparency in AI use, and incorporating reflective assignments can help students critically evaluate their interactions with AI tools, promoting a more ethical and thoughtful approach to writing. Finally, instructors should implement differentiated instruction that recognizes and supports various approaches to AI integration. This approach involves providing guidance that helps students develop effective AI literacy skills while respecting their individual preferences and writing strategies.

While this study provides valuable insights into the use of GenAI in research writing, it is important to acknowledge its limitations. First, the study was conducted over a short duration—only one semester—which limits the ability to observe long-term trends or the sustained impact of GenAI on writing development. Second, the study focused exclusively on learners’ perspectives, leaving out the viewpoints of other key stakeholders, such as instructors and writing tutors. Addressing these limitations, future research should explore the following key areas to further understand the impact of GenAI on research writing. [Longitudinal studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/longitudinal-analysis "Learn more about Longitudinal studies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") are needed to track students’ engagement with GenAI and their writing practices over an extended period and cross different research writing assignments. Additionally, to complement the learner perspectives examined in this study, future research should include qualitative data from other stakeholders. Interviewing these stakeholders, along with analyzing written feedback and conducting class observations, will provide a more comprehensive view of how GenAI are perceived and utilized within an academic context. By addressing these limitations, future studies can offer a more robust understanding of the multifaceted role of GenAI in academic writing.
