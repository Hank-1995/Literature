Preparing students to be responsible
and creative citizens in the era of AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integral to our lives,
necessitating proactive education systems to prepare students to
be responsible users and co-creators of AI. Integrating AI learning
objectives into official school curricula is crucial for students globally
to engage safely and meaningfully with AI.
## The UNESCO AI competency framework for students aims to help
educators in this integration, outlining 12 competencies across four
dimensions: Human-centred mindset, Ethics of AI, AI techniques
and applications, and AI system design. These competencies span
three progression levels: Understand,
Apply, and Create. The framework details

Foreword
The past decade has seen widespread adoption of artificial
intelligence (AI) in all areas of human development, with the public
release of generative AI tools in November 2022 only accelerating
its permeation within social life. The education sector, which is at
the heart of the transformation of human societies, has been no
exception.
This process of rapid technological change brings multiple
opportunities but also risks and challenges for students, teachers
and society at large. In the era of AI, school students need to be
prepared to become active co-creators of AI, as well as future leaders
© UNESCO who will shape novel iterations of the technology and define its
relationship with society.
This is exactly the ambition of UNESCO’s AI competency framework for students – the first ever
global framework of its kind. It aims to support the development of core competencies for
students to become responsible and creative citizens, equipped to thrive in the AI era. This will
help students acquire the values, knowledge and skills necessary to examine and understand AI
critically from a holistic perspective, including its ethical, social and technical dimensions.
The new framework embodies UNESCO’s mandate by anchoring its vision of AI and education
in principles of human rights, inclusion and equity. This approach seeks to ensure that AI
supports the development of human capabilities, protects human dignity and agency, and
promotes justice and sustainability.
The publication builds on UNESCO’s previous work in the field, such as the ICT competency
framework for teachers, AI and education: Guidance for policy-makers, and the more recent
Guidance for generative AI in education and research. It reflects the contributions of a wide range
of stakeholders, drawing on UNESCO Member States’ insights on developing and implementing
AI school curricula, the expertise of an international working group, three international
consultation meetings, and multiple rounds of online consultations.
## The AI competency framework for students has been developed hand in hand with a
competency framework for teachers. It is my hope that these two frameworks will empower
students and teachers to shape the digital futures we want.
In a world characterized by rising complexity and uncertainty, it is our collective responsibility
to ensure that education remains the central space for transformation of our shared futures.

Box 2: Supporting human resource development: The Republic of Korea’s
## National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence
## The Republic of Korea’s National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence has three main focus areas:
(1) Establish reliable AI infrastructure, including to support human talent and improve
technology; (2) expand the utilization of AI throughout the industrial and social sectors; and
(3) respond proactively to social changes, including labour market needs. The strategy seeks
to develop an AI ecosystem that results in the full-scale utilization of AI, and establishes the
Republic of Korea as a global leader in people-centred artificial intelligence.
To support the achievement of this goal, the Republic of Korea has focused on revising
regulations to create a more industry-friendly environment and nurture the productive use
of data and AI innovations, the use of AI to streamline governance, the establishment of
regulations on AI ethics, and the building of human capital in AI from as early as primary
school. The strategy proposes an interdisciplinary AI curriculum and the definition of AI
competencies based on the needs of four categories of populations: (1) the general public,
who need to be able to use AI, as well as acquire basic AI and data literacy, including
knowledge of AI ethics; (2) AI practitioners, who apply AI and software tools in ‘AI + X’
environments in the labour market; (3) AI professionals, who develop AI platforms and
systems; and (4) AI talents, who will resolve AI issues and develop new AI models and
algorithms.
In alignment with competency development for these four categories, the strategy suggests
regulations to upskill and upgrade industry professionals to the level of professorships in AI,
support the expansion of existing AI departments, and mobilize more departments to offer
programmes related to AI, including through expanding the scale and diversity of education
and research programmes in AI at the master’s and doctoral levels and through creating
interdisciplinary majors on AI.
As for school level, the strategy seeks to expand learning opportunities on AI with a focus
on computational thinking. At the lower grades of primary school, students are offered
experiential engagement with AI to foster their interest and curiosity; at the higher primary
grades, students are supported to extend their knowledge and skills through applying AI
in the learning of core subjects. Secondary-level students have the opportunity to attend
AI-centred schools to complete a more advanced AI curriculum. Teachers are also supported
to enhance their knowledge and skills on AI through integrating AI in their initial training
programmes and providing new degrees on AI pedagogy integration.

to thrive in the dynamic and interconnected world by nurturing critical thinking, problem-
solving abilities and innovation.’
## The United Arab Emirates takes an interdisciplinary approach to its AI curriculum for K-12
schools by integrating it into a curriculum called Computing, Creative Design and Innovation
(CCDI). By including a focus on AI, the CCDI curriculum encourages students to develop their
creativity and problem-solving skills; build an awareness of ethics and ethical impacts; learn
and rehearse fundamental AI principles and concepts; and cross-fertilize their knowledge
across fields. The curriculum was first established in 2016 as a technology-focused subject
area, over and above the already-existing computer science curriculum.
Since then, and with the recent developments in the field of AI, the CCDI has progressively
integrated robotics, programming, 3D-modelling and electronics. In 2020 the curriculum
was revised to cover five domains: (1) computer science, with a focus on computer systems,
networks and the internet, data and analysis, algorithms and programming, and the
impacts of computing; (2) engineering principles and systems, with a focus on electricity
and electrons, robotics and systems, and embedded systems; (3) design and innovation,
including entrepreneurship and the engineering design process; (4) sustainability, with
an emphasis on the sustainable society; and (5) visual communication, concentrating on
graphics for design, computer-aided design and design realization.

## The AI curriculum developed by MIT’s RAISE 9 initiative, Day of AI, adopted the spiral design
approach by clustering curricular content around key topics such as ‘What AI is, and what AI
does well and what AI does not do as well’, ‘How AI works’, ‘How a machine learns’ and ‘How
a machine creates’. Students at different ages were given opportunities to continuously
engage in topics such as ‘What is AI?’, while being gradually exposed to novel or upgraded
knowledge and skills such as algorithms and AI programming, teachable machines and
generative AI. Cross-cutting topics around ethics, including AI biases, human rights, human–
AI interaction and the social impact of AI were tailored to students at different age levels.

Box 7: Pedagogical methodologies in the MIT curriculum on the ethics of AI for
middle school students
An ethics of artificial intelligence curriculum for middle school students was created by Blakeley
H. Payne with support from the MIT Media Lab Personal Robots Group, directed by Cynthia
Breazeal (Payne, 2019). The curriculum is designed to be implemented online and/or offline
with students aged 12 to 14 who are early in their AI learning journeys. The curriculum
focuses on improving students’ understanding of AI and the relationships between humans,
technology and society. Parts of this curriculum have also been integrated into the MIT DAILy
Curriculum,18 and into How to Train Your Robot: A Middle School AI and Ethics Curriculum.
Research into the latter demonstrated the potential for such a curriculum to be delivered even
by teachers with a limited computer science background (Williams et al., 2021).
This curriculum exemplifies a student-centred and inquiry-based approach, with learning
outcomes that are aligned to enable a cycle of: initial orientation or information-gathering
that supports students to build knowledge schemas on a new topic; conceptualization,
where students begin to form a hypothesis around the purpose(s) of AI; investigation, in
which students delve deeper into the different perspectives, benefits, values and risks of AI
for different populations, and design potential solutions for the problems that emerge; and
finally, the development of a potential solution prototype using a project-based approach.
Throughout, discussion and reflection are leveraged to deepen understanding and thinking
about the problem.
The curriculum includes six core goals, which are pursued through different online or offline
activities depending on the context. The chart below outlines the goals as well as example
activities for teachers or other facilitators that can help to achieve them

AI competency framework for students – Chapter 5: Applying the framework
The focuses of domain-specific assessments divided by three progression levels are
recommended as follows for further deliberation, and a non-exhaustive list of examples of
assessment items is provided in Table 5 to inspire configurations of assessment instruments
that cover all topics and progression levels of the local curriculum.
## 1. Human-centred mindset:
1.1 Conflict-based opinion taking
1.2 Conflict-based critical evaluation
1.3 Conflict-based social actions
## 2. Ethics of AI:
2.1 Scenario-based ethical value orientation
2.2 Scenario-based ethical behaviour
2.3 Scenario-based rule-making
## 3. AI techniques and applications:
3.1 Problem-based AI knowledge and understanding
3.2 Tool-based conceptual insights and transferable operation
3.3 Task-based tool crafting
## 4. AI system design:
4.1 Project-based design thinking
4.2 Project-based system configuration
4.3 Project-based iteration
The three forms of assessment under AI system design are based on the virtual environment
of Teachable Machine and a simulation project on the design, training, testing and
optimization of an AI system. The project should be defined around themes relating to the
real-world needs of promoting social inclusion, and using data on local languages or cultural
features when training AI models. One critical aspect of the integrated AI competency is the
comprehensive ability to iterate AI systems based on feedback, and therefore traditional
methods such as paper-based testing should be expanded upon to include metrics that
capture a student’s ability to conduct technological conceptualization, and create prototypes
and processes for improvements, together with their technical expertise demonstrated in
the projects.

AI competency framework
for students
## The AI competency framework for students presented here is based on an
ambitious vision that extends well beyond popular notions of AI literacy.
It aims to support students to grow towards being not only eff ective and
ethical users of AI tools, but also co-creators in the design of more inclusive
and environmentally sustainable AI. The framework defi nes the values, as well
as the foundational knowledge and transferable skills, required to critically
understand and use AI systems in a safe, eff ective and meaningful manner at
diff erent levels of mastery. The framework also proposes detailed specifi cations
on what AI topics can be covered and what pedagogical methods may be
deployed to facilitate students’ understanding, application, and creation of AI.
It further provides guidance for the curricular integration of AI-related learning,
the organization of learning sequences, and the design of competence-based
assessments. Seen as an integral set of capabilities required for responsible
citizenship in the era of AI, the competencies outlined in this framework
are based on principles of inclusivity, the centrality of human agency, non-
discrimination, and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity.
