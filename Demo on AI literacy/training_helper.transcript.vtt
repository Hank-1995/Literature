00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.380
Simon Wang: Recording this, alright, so…

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:15.919
Simon Wang: Yeah, thank you for your interest, thank you for taking the time to join the briefing session today, and also to serve as a student helper.

3
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:26.819
Simon Wang: for the workshop. And, of course, you know, this video will be made available for other students who might be interested in, this as well.

4
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.209
Simon Wang: And

5
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:41.169
Simon Wang: in addition to the upcoming workshop that we're going to run at Hong Kong Yu, there will be another Friday workshop.

6
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.740
Simon Wang: in the first Friday of November.

7
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:57.610
Simon Wang: Actually, on that day, in the morning, 1.30 to 2.30, I will be running a workshop just one hour for a group of research students from biology department.

8
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.040
Simon Wang: And then…

9
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:09.349
Simon Wang: Around 4.30pm, I will go to communication school. There's another small group of PhD students. I'll be running workshop over there.

10
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.900
Simon Wang: So I expect there will be kind of a workshop series

11
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.910
Simon Wang: in the coming weeks, and also next semester, that I will be introducing, AI Agent.

12
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.980
Simon Wang: So… I mean, today's briefing is…

13
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.019
Simon Wang: a couple of reasons, a couple of objectives. One is to, kind of.

14
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:44.229
Simon Wang: Give everybody here another round of, so-called training, so you know What you need to do.

15
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:54.740
Simon Wang: And most importantly, when you become a student assistant in a workshop environment, You need to work with

16
00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:12.909
Simon Wang: participants who have, you know, near-zero, experience of, programming, near-zero experience of, AI agent, or IDE, integrated,

17
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:20.469
Simon Wang: development environments, and I assume that most of you have got some experience. So…

18
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:31.879
Simon Wang: you need to be able to basically troubleshoot, right? So when… when a participant run into difficulties or obstacles, you need to help.

19
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.570
Simon Wang: Help them to overcome And,

20
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.990
Simon Wang: So that's, that's kind of a more technical side, so… so when, when you,

21
00:02:44.070 --> 00:03:01.979
Simon Wang: later on, I'm going to invite you to go through a couple steps. You need to, of course, you have to go through the steps, but then more importantly, you need to consider and kind of imagine what kind of problems or difficulties that the participants may run into, you know, during the workshop.

22
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.540
Simon Wang: I'm not quite sure about the… the setting on Friday evening.

23
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.770
Simon Wang: Hopefully there will be enough space for you to walk around and help, students.

24
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.280
Simon Wang: But before we get into the more hands-on part, I just want to…

25
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.010
Simon Wang: Kind of, talk a little bit about… The basics, alright?

26
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.490
Simon Wang: So…

27
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:38.459
Simon Wang: There are two ways to communicate with AI, so this would be sort of, kind of a more conceptual level of discussion here.

28
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:47.059
Simon Wang: One way is to talk to your AI through browser, right? If you go to… PoE, for example.

29
00:03:47.680 --> 00:04:01.230
Simon Wang: and there's a browser here, and you talk to different models. You type some prompts, and the chatbot will respond, so you have a natural language conversation.

30
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.219
Simon Wang: And obviously, this is a pretty intuitive and also very…

31
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:17.330
Simon Wang: convenient way of talking to AI. But, it's also very time-consuming in the sense that if you have to, like, write in an essay or doing something else.

32
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.160
Simon Wang: There will be constant context switching, right? So you have to go back and forth.

33
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.180
Simon Wang: And that's actually… I think that's a major limitation, because…

34
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.900
Simon Wang: On the one hand, you need to give the AI all the contextual information about what you're doing.

35
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:41.410
Simon Wang: by copy and pasting, but then, even through extensive copy-pasting, AI won't be able to

36
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.759
Simon Wang: Access all the context or contextual information about your project.

37
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.369
Simon Wang: But, now, what we are going to do is to basically

38
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.869
Simon Wang: introduces IDE, Integrated Development Environment, and this term could be very…

39
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.380
Simon Wang: Unfamiliar to a lot of participants with little programming.

40
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.830
Simon Wang: background, because essentially IDE is a tool for development.

41
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:22.259
Simon Wang: And I consider this as… as my innovation. I don't know how much, credit I can claim, because I'm pretty sure that other people

42
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.279
Simon Wang: Have probably thought of something similar.

43
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:33.160
Simon Wang: But, I think this is a little bit unusual, that we are borrowing this idea and tools from

44
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.640
Simon Wang: programming community from people who do programming primarily.

45
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.559
Simon Wang: But then we're gonna take this tool, but then we're going to introduce it to non-programmers.

46
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.929
Simon Wang: So, one thing I have to clarify is that the workshop on Friday and also

47
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:58.309
Simon Wang: the upcoming workshops are not really vibe coding, okay? It is not vibe coding, because

48
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.509
Simon Wang: Well, at least VIP coding is not the primary focus.

49
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.439
Simon Wang: Because even though IDE or AI Agent is very good at supporting VIP coding.

50
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.610
Simon Wang: I'm actually trying to teach…

51
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.500
Simon Wang: the participants to benefit from the IDE, but then to perform all non-programming tasks.

52
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:27.860
Simon Wang: But of course, while we're doing non-programming tasks, from time to time, we might benefit from some tools.

53
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.969
Simon Wang: That involves whole programming. For example.

54
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:49.259
Simon Wang: AI agent cannot really read PDF, right? If you send a file pass of a PDF file to the AI agent, the AI agent will say, sorry, I cannot really read PDF, but then what do you do?

55
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:55.260
Simon Wang: Well, you can just write a Python program to convert the PDF into Markdown.

56
00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.709
Simon Wang: Right? And that can be done, ad hoc, so it's an ad hoc programming task.

57
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.340
Simon Wang: So,

58
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:21.280
Simon Wang: it's like, okay, so there's, like, a couple of PDFs in the folder, and you tell the agent, say, oh, we've got a couple of PDFs in this folder, can you write a, Python program to convert the PDF into Markdown? And then the AI agent will do it right away.

59
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:40.929
Simon Wang: and then there will be a script, a Python program, and the AI agent will not just write the Python program, it will install all the requirements, all the dependencies, and then run the program, and there will be a couple of markdown files in the same folder as the PDFs.

60
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.780
Simon Wang: So all this can be done,

61
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:49.760
Simon Wang: by just one or two lines of instructions sent to AI agent.

62
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:58.260
Simon Wang: But, I'm not trying to teach this, like, vibe coding, Because…

63
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:05.740
Simon Wang: it's kind of peripheral, right? It's not our main concern, right? So what is our main concern?

64
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:13.059
Simon Wang: Our main concern is actually Trying to showcase the potential and the…

65
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:18.720
Simon Wang: power of AI Agent for academic rating.

66
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.550
Simon Wang: and academic research.

67
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:32.590
Simon Wang: Okay? That's why on Friday, and also, you know, later on, my primary… Audience would be research students.

68
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:38.989
Simon Wang: Okay. Now… For you guys, who are undergraduates, you are mostly,

69
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:48.470
Simon Wang: first year, second year, or maybe third year undergraduates. I think most of the students here are actually first or second year students.

70
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:54.040
Simon Wang: I would consider this an opportunity for you to connect with the research community.

71
00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:02.880
Simon Wang: And of course, not everybody will eventually join the research community, you know, you may not pursue an advanced degree or PhD or whatever.

72
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:21.010
Simon Wang: But, still, you know, it would be a good opportunity to, to kind of learn… learn more about how people do research, right? Because later on, you will have to write your FYP, right? A final year project, that's also a piece of research work you need to do.

73
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:27.049
Simon Wang: So… In a way, what…

74
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.790
Simon Wang: What we are trying to do here is to figure out How we can,

75
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:40.529
Simon Wang: Leverage this tool to support, research and support writing.

76
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:50.780
Simon Wang: Now, I'm not… trying to claim, and actually, I do not have a complete solution.

77
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.829
Simon Wang: Regarding how to use AI agent to support research and writing.

78
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:03.830
Simon Wang: Some of the ideas are actually half-baked. It's not a mature solution.

79
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:15.829
Simon Wang: But, I decided to run some workshop anyway, is because, number one, I feel that, this is such an exciting and powerful tool that,

80
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.560
Simon Wang: the earlier.

81
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:34.439
Simon Wang: to introduce it to more people, the better, right? But then, more importantly, I think this is a learning process for everybody, okay? Not just for the participants of the workshop, but for myself as well. Because through interacting with the

82
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:42.170
Simon Wang: the research students And learn about their needs, and, explore how these tools can help them.

83
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.120
Simon Wang: This will be a very useful

84
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:50.050
Simon Wang: experience for me as well, because I have…

85
00:10:50.550 --> 00:11:04.630
Simon Wang: this job, which is to help research students to develop their AI skills, and, to use AI to empower, research and writing, okay? So, so that's, that's,

86
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:12.190
Simon Wang: That's kind of the background here. Now, there's another article I want to quickly show you guys.

87
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.880
Simon Wang: Which is…

88
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:26.849
Simon Wang: Right here. So, I probably, if somebody can help me, you know, we can put a link here.

89
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.170
Simon Wang: And maybe a couple of bullet points.

90
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.699
Simon Wang: And this is… this is a very recent paper.

91
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.309
Simon Wang: Not really a paper, but more like an article.

92
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:48.830
Simon Wang: But it provides a good, kind of, introduction?

93
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.880
Simon Wang: to the AI agent?

94
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:55.970
Simon Wang: in the context of, supporting research, so I think…

95
00:11:56.090 --> 00:12:01.550
Simon Wang: you know, during the workshop at the beginning, I'll probably just, introduced this…

96
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.270
Simon Wang: This, article a little bit.

97
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:11.720
Simon Wang: Because what we are doing… Is, quite similar, right?

98
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.240
Simon Wang: So what is an AI agent?

99
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:21.449
Simon Wang: It is not doTERRO, right? doTERRO, like, citation managers, everybody use that.

100
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.570
Simon Wang: But,

101
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:44.569
Simon Wang: Agents use large language models to make and refine plans on the fly for a variety of multi-step goals. Unlike long LLMs, they also harness tools to take action in the real world, for instance, to write and run codes or navigate databases.

102
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.029
Simon Wang: With some interacting with each other.

103
00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:54.229
Simon Wang: And using working memory to remember user preferences and previous actions.

104
00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:01.850
Simon Wang: So, through these statements, we kind of get a glimpse of the state-of-the-art technologies.

105
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:08.569
Simon Wang: So, what we are going to demonstrate Are not as…

106
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:17.599
Simon Wang: fancy or as, as, advanced, or sophisticated as… What the paragraph… describes here.

107
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.780
Simon Wang: But, we are pretty close, okay? I think…

108
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:27.290
Simon Wang: some of the basic operations and techniques that I'm going to demonstrate.

109
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.380
Simon Wang: would… Would be pretty close to this.

110
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:32.510
Simon Wang: Okay.

111
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:37.030
Simon Wang: Yeah, so… so…

112
00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:47.620
Simon Wang: And we can read a bit more. Here it says, streamlining everyday research tasks is one goal, and according to this particular

113
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:59.899
Simon Wang: The researcher… Hold on one second, I think it seems like this researcher is coming to… be you.

114
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.499
Simon Wang: Or it could be a different one.

115
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:14.019
Simon Wang: Yeah, it's a different one. Okay, anyway, so here, he says,

116
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:23.580
Simon Wang: Every PhD student now has their own AI agent that effectively serves as a research assistant

117
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:31.049
Simon Wang: Okay, these homemade agents, You see, homemade agents.

118
00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:41.320
Simon Wang: Help the team to perform low-stakes tasks, such as curating datasets, turning text into tables, and writing certain pieces of text.

119
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:49.070
Simon Wang: Now, unfortunately, because it's a homemade agent, we have no idea how exactly that would work.

120
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.570
Simon Wang: But just based on this description, it sounds pretty exciting.

121
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:58.099
Simon Wang: And, what I'm going to demonstrate on Friday, and also tonight.

122
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.779
Simon Wang: I hope, it can…

123
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:09.200
Simon Wang: it can be comparable to what is being described here. And notice that, this piece…

124
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:14.610
Simon Wang: Was published early this month, so this is pretty… You know, recent.

125
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:31.299
Simon Wang: probably the latest development of the technology. So, in a sense, I think we are at the frontier of this application of AI agent, okay? So, I hope all of you could

126
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:40.599
Simon Wang: recognize the potential of this tool. And, not just, when you join the workshop and help

127
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.300
Simon Wang: the research students

128
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:48.649
Simon Wang: But, you want to think about how this tool can also change the way you learn, right?

129
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:55.509
Simon Wang: Yeah, so, so, sounds, sounds, hopefully it sounds pretty exciting.

130
00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.910
Simon Wang: Nope.

131
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:13.230
Simon Wang: This is the… repository, GitHub repository, and I assume all of you have got The,

132
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:19.230
Simon Wang: Because right now, there's only two forked. That means most of you have not yet forked.

133
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.229
Simon Wang: So maybe you guys can go ahead and forkt?

134
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.859
Simon Wang: This, repository?

135
00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:32.210
Simon Wang: If you haven't done it, and once you've forked.

136
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.150
Simon Wang: So, you can actually…

137
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:47.540
Simon Wang: Because I cannot fork again, because there's already… it's my repository, but I can go to another…

138
00:16:47.650 --> 00:17:00.110
Simon Wang: my other account, or team, and then I can fork it. So I create a fork, so everybody please do that. And more importantly, we want to consider

139
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:05.460
Simon Wang: like, how… You know, on Friday.

140
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:13.319
Simon Wang: you know, hopefully everybody will be able to do it fairly, in a fairly straightforward way, okay?

141
00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.270
Simon Wang: So please go ahead and do that.

142
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:26.990
Simon Wang: Oh, by the way, maybe you should also star it. You know, because in a GitHub world, star is a,

143
00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:38.109
Simon Wang: just, like, like, right? How many stars you're gonna get would be a good sign of, how good this repository is. So, everybody, please star.

144
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.410
Simon Wang: The repository.

145
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:46.130
Simon Wang: Oh, actually, it's not this one, but the previous one, but this one.

146
00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:47.840
Simon Wang: Okay.

147
00:17:50.050 --> 00:18:01.350
Simon Wang: Great, so it looks like everybody has just forked, which is great. Now, once you forked, you essentially gather your own copy of this repository.

148
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:10.599
Simon Wang: But, later on, you will have the opportunity to synchronize, and also to contribute, okay? And, and that's something…

149
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.259
Simon Wang: We can discuss a little bit later.

150
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.980
Simon Wang: In fact.

151
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:30.630
Simon Wang: all of you could potentially contribute to this, repository, right? Especially if you are more advanced in programming, or if you have some good ideas in terms of use case, I'd be happy to, you know.

152
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.430
Simon Wang: You know, get more help and input from you.

153
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:43.740
Simon Wang: Now, once everybody is forked, everybody got their own version or copy of the repository under their own account.

154
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:47.370
Simon Wang: The next step is to open the code space.

155
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:53.649
Simon Wang: On the virtual GitHub environment.

156
00:18:54.190 --> 00:19:01.859
Simon Wang: Because now, we need to use AI Agent to kind of run these codes.

157
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.349
Simon Wang: And, to write files and everything.

158
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:17.340
Simon Wang: But, one way, of course, is you can open up a VS Code, and you can set up a folder, and then you can clone this.

159
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:26.649
Simon Wang: Whole repository to the local folder, and then you can work on the local folder, and then later on, you can push the local, modified version back.

160
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:32.249
Simon Wang: to the… Github reporter. But now.

161
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.549
Simon Wang: I want to take a more, kind of.

162
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:45.989
Simon Wang: I wouldn't call it a shortcut, but it's kind of a more convenient option, which is instead of installing VS Code on your local computer, because that can take

163
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.590
Simon Wang: some time, we're gonna just create a code space.

164
00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:56.319
Simon Wang: on the… Kind of a virtual environment.

165
00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:03.330
Simon Wang: And it got its, it's got its, advantage, right, because you don't have to worry about…

166
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.290
Simon Wang: the… Installing anything.

167
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:23.430
Simon Wang: But, of course, it also has its disadvantage. One thing is, if you leave it inactive for a while, it may be… become inactive, it will be automatically closed.

168
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.760
Simon Wang: Okay?

169
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:33.870
Simon Wang: So, now, we are in this environment, and I would assume everybody can, you know.

170
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:50.099
Simon Wang: get to here, no problem. But, if we're running a workshop for non-computer science majors, or for students with limited experience, then even this step, we have to ensure everybody's on the same page.

171
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.280
Simon Wang: Now, once we enter here, we can…

172
00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:00.460
Simon Wang: Basically, very quickly explain to, to the…

173
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:07.189
Simon Wang: Participants that, on the left-hand side, we got some folders and subfolders, right?

174
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:08.690
Simon Wang: Okay.

175
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.530
Simon Wang: So this would be…

176
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:18.609
Simon Wang: like, our project folder. You consider this as a project folder. There are different files, subfolders, and everything.

177
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:28.200
Simon Wang: And then, here is, area where we edit a specific file, okay?

178
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:40.569
Simon Wang: And then this is the terminal area, which is where we can write some command lines. Or sometimes the AI agent will write a command line, run command lines for us.

179
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:53.150
Simon Wang: And on the right-hand side, this is the most exciting part, because this is where we're going to talk to AI, and it's not a chatbot, but it is actually an agent.

180
00:21:54.230 --> 00:22:02.910
Simon Wang: So you can say hi… Now, if the students is the first time to say hi to,

181
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:04.840
Simon Wang: the agent…

182
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:15.520
Simon Wang: then they will be asked to sign in again, which is confusing, because, you know, we already signed in, that's how we get here, but then we need to sign in again.

183
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:32.670
Simon Wang: I mean, in my case, because I signed in before, I got this step skipped, but for the participants of the workshop, they may have to sign in again, so we have to explain to them, okay, sorry about the actual trouble, but whatever, you have to just sign in.

184
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.430
Simon Wang: And also.

185
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:43.889
Simon Wang: Because they are under free account, and probably you are also under free account, the kind of…

186
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:50.430
Simon Wang: The kind of agent that you can access would be limited.

187
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:57.100
Simon Wang: It would be very different from what I've got, because I got a education benefit.

188
00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:05.660
Simon Wang: Okay. Actually, I'm not paying… for the keyhub agent, instead, I apply for education benefit.

189
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:17.250
Simon Wang: So this is why I actually would encourage everybody to apply for education benefit, and I will, encourage all the workshop participants to do so as well.

190
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.170
Simon Wang: And that process is not necessarily smooth.

191
00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.700
Simon Wang: You, you could get rejected for, for different reasons.

192
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.119
Simon Wang: And that's something separately we can talk about.

193
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:37.869
Simon Wang: But one thing we do want to remind students before they go ahead and talk to the AI is to ensure that they actually select the agent.

194
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.450
Simon Wang: Not ask, not edit.

195
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.109
Simon Wang: Because if they are… they select ask or edit.

196
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:59.049
Simon Wang: the behavior will be very, very different, okay? Only when agent is selected and there's a check next to it, we will be able to enjoy the full benefits of an agent, which is autonomously performing certain tasks.

197
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.980
Simon Wang: Okay?

198
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:10.090
Simon Wang: So now we are in business. We can start talking to AI.

199
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:18.799
Simon Wang: The basic operation would be something that we can demonstrate at the very beginning.

200
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:24.709
Simon Wang: Which is to intra- which is the first folder here, Introduction to Agent.

201
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:25.960
Simon Wang: Okay?

202
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:33.370
Simon Wang: And we need to… Present some…

203
00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.940
Simon Wang: Operations and steps, and we need to give

204
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:45.389
Simon Wang: The participants some, opportunities to… Practice.

205
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.319
Simon Wang: So that's why I prepared a Jupyter notebook.

206
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:56.519
Simon Wang: Okay? So this is the file, under folder practice, under Introduction to Agent.

207
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.030
Simon Wang: We have a Jupyter notebook.

208
00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:03.560
Simon Wang: But this Jupyter Notebook is actually,

209
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:20.969
Simon Wang: very basic, okay? So, we could change this… change this a little bit. And, I mean, I'm not even sure we should use Jupyter Notebook, but we can decide, you know, we can decide tonight, we can fix the codes a little bit tomorrow.

210
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:25.549
Simon Wang: So, and then on Friday, we will present this.

211
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:28.370
Simon Wang: Now.

212
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:39.949
Simon Wang: This exercise says, create a research project structure. Ask your AI agents to create a folder structure for your research project.

213
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:54.150
Simon Wang: Okay? And use AI agent to generate codes for creating research folder structure. Now, actually, I'm not necessarily would ask the AI agent to.

214
00:25:55.830 --> 00:26:06.040
Simon Wang: write any codes, because I think AI kind of misunderstood me. I'm not asking to generate codes. I'm asking AI agent to create folders

215
00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.759
Simon Wang: Directly. Okay, so what do we do?

216
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:16.609
Simon Wang: Actually, we can… write… A simple instruction file.

217
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.279
Simon Wang: Let's call it instruction.md.

218
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:30.150
Simon Wang: And, we're gonna say, well… We're gonna say, generate…

219
00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:36.530
Simon Wang: So, well, usually, usually we say input, process, output, right?

220
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:42.910
Simon Wang: So, let's say input… process… Output.

221
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:43.860
Simon Wang: Right.

222
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.429
Simon Wang: So, what is input?

223
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:53.170
Simon Wang: The input could be a… Expected structure, right?

224
00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.409
Simon Wang: we call it… Expert is structural.

225
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:58.760
Simon Wang: Alright.

226
00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:11.920
Simon Wang: So what is… What is the, the, the, the process? The process is to take this… structure above.

227
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:25.500
Simon Wang: And, generate a set of… Generate a folder, And some subfolders.

228
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.920
Simon Wang: Based on this structure.

229
00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.310
Simon Wang: Okay? And what is output? Well, output would be…

230
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:45.620
Simon Wang: We create a folder here, and we call it… Research.

231
00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:53.460
Simon Wang: Okay? And then… we… Copy pass. Now, this is a very important step.

232
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.629
Simon Wang: Because you need to tell the AI agent

233
00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:03.390
Simon Wang: where to look for folder or anything. So, when you right-click.

234
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:10.200
Simon Wang: and you select this folder called Research, and you copy-pass.

235
00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:19.389
Simon Wang: So, you, you copy and past here, and you say, put… the subfolders.

236
00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.200
Simon Wang: Here.

237
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:35.010
Simon Wang: Now… We have a instruction file here, And we copy this… File pass again.

238
00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:46.139
Simon Wang: And we can say, execute… the instructions.

239
00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.120
Simon Wang: Okay.

240
00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:53.110
Simon Wang: in the file. And… and this is actually optional.

241
00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:54.660
Simon Wang: You see what I mean? If

242
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.259
Simon Wang: If the agent is smart enough.

243
00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:02.530
Simon Wang: You don't even have to say that. You simply provide a file pass.

244
00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:15.289
Simon Wang: And, when you provide a file pass, The agent will read the instruction files.

245
00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:23.049
Simon Wang: And then it will create the subfolders for us.

246
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.560
Simon Wang: and put it… Here.

247
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:26.760
Simon Wang: Okay?

248
00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:31.410
Simon Wang: Now, this is just a very quick demo.

249
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:44.770
Simon Wang: to… illustrate The power of… AI agent, Because now… What do we get from…

250
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.339
Simon Wang: The AI is not just text…

251
00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.900
Simon Wang: responses, right? It's not like talking to a chatbot.

252
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.070
Simon Wang: We provide some instruction, including file paths.

253
00:29:55.290 --> 00:30:05.150
Simon Wang: And the AI agent would be able to read the file… Through the file path, And, understand…

254
00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:11.090
Simon Wang: The instruction there, understand the input, process, and output, And then the output…

255
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.230
Simon Wang: of the AI agent is not text, but action.

256
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.279
Simon Wang: Even though the action seems to be pretty…

257
00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:24.499
Simon Wang: rudimentary, right? Because you can also do it through GUI.

258
00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:30.879
Simon Wang: You can create… you can create a new folder here by yourself, and you can name it

259
00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.370
Simon Wang: You see what I mean?

260
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:39.950
Simon Wang: But… I think this is very significant, it's a game changer.

261
00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:47.150
Simon Wang: Because now, The AI chatbot is no longer a chatbot. It's no longer just produced text.

262
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:52.360
Simon Wang: But, because of there's some underlying technology behind this.

263
00:30:53.960 --> 00:31:03.189
Simon Wang: It's still a large language model, but large language model demonstrating human-like intelligence will be able to call certain tools

264
00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.520
Simon Wang: And to perform certain actions for us.

265
00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:09.390
Simon Wang: Alright?

266
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:24.110
Simon Wang: I cannot… under… I should say, I cannot overstate The importance and the potential Of this technology.

267
00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.440
Simon Wang: And for the workshop participants.

268
00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:41.220
Simon Wang: They probably need a little bit of time to process this information and to appreciate the importance and the significance and the implication of this technology.

269
00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:49.730
Simon Wang: Because…

270
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.670
Simon Wang: Now… AI is not just a… Talking, buddy.

271
00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.679
Simon Wang: It's not just to chat.

272
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.059
Simon Wang: Or serving as a sounding board.

273
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.689
Simon Wang: But it can perform actions.

274
00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:16.080
Simon Wang: I mean, creating a folder is just one of the actions. There's… of course, here it's not just creating a folder, it's understand your instruction.

275
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:17.670
Simon Wang: and execute.

276
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.929
Simon Wang: And you can also create files.

277
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.480
Simon Wang: Alright.

278
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:33.969
Simon Wang: But now, of course, I'm still thinking how we should, go about this. I mean… for the…

279
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:41.150
Simon Wang: For this part, introduction to agent, in addition to creating… a…

280
00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:47.359
Simon Wang: In addition to creating a folder, maybe we should also demonstrate something else,

281
00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:53.059
Simon Wang: But, that's something else we… we can… we can decide. In fact, I've got…

282
00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:06.880
Simon Wang: I've got different, I've got different, options and files and everything. So, let me,

283
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:18.380
Simon Wang: Let me show you guys… a quick example, I probably used that example

284
00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:23.980
Simon Wang: on Friday.

285
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:31.600
Simon Wang: But while I'm, I'm, preparing that, that files, maybe you guys can…

286
00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.149
Simon Wang: Tell me a little bit about what you think.

287
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:43.190
Simon Wang: Because, as I said earlier,

288
00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:49.829
Simon Wang: I hope you guys can also think about how this tool can change the way you learn.

289
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:55.510
Simon Wang: I mean, I'm actually open to… Different opinions.

290
00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:07.160
Simon Wang: I won't mind at all if you disagree. If you say, hey, I don't think this is a very promising tool, this is too much trouble.

291
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.449
Simon Wang: I don't think people would pick it up.

292
00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.769
Simon Wang: I mean, fine. Just tell me, what do you think?

293
00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:23.219
Simon Wang: But, yeah. So, I'm gonna pause here, because I would like each of you to…

294
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.560
Simon Wang: To think about it a little bit, Okay.

295
00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:38.820
Simon Wang: Nina!

296
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:40.969
Simon Wang: Maybe you should talk first.

297
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:42.370
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: Yeah.

298
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:52.679
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: So I think that this is a good tool, and it can be properly used by many students. I think it's pretty easy to pick up, because…

299
00:34:52.830 --> 00:35:07.740
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: it's just, like, text to action, and, I think the main thing would be that this is mainly still going to be used for coding rather than non-coding purposes, but that's probably my only concern on this.

300
00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:12.400
Simon Wang: Well, if you think it's only for coding, then,

301
00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:19.390
Simon Wang: Maybe you can revisit this idea after we complete The entire demo tonight.

302
00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:27.150
Simon Wang: Because I think I mentioned this very earlier, which is… You're right.

303
00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:34.230
Simon Wang: the whole IDE thing, the whole edge, agent thing, most people use it for software development, for writing code.

304
00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:39.759
Simon Wang: what I'm trying to demonstrate on Friday and in the coming weeks

305
00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.569
Simon Wang: My focus is not vibe coding.

306
00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:53.579
Simon Wang: I mean, I have got some experience, very good experience of vibe coding. I think it's worth introducing, maybe on a separate occasion, but…

307
00:35:53.710 --> 00:36:00.720
Simon Wang: I'm actually trying to demonstrate how this kind of… the whole platform, the whole thing can be used for non…

308
00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:03.609
Simon Wang: non, non-textual.

309
00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:04.690
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: non-provo.

310
00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:06.600
Simon Wang: Yeah, non-programming task.

311
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:22.239
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: I completely understand, but I think that for now, in general, like, before your talk, most students still would still use this for coding. I think after your talk, they might actually realize that you can't use it for non-coding purposes, so the talk is probably going to be important.

312
00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.510
Simon Wang: Yep. Yep.

313
00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:29.140
Simon Wang: But let me, let me show you… let me show you this,

314
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:35.210
Simon Wang: link. But, other students, please… Also, share.

315
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.170
24201413 HADI Muhammad: So…

316
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:52.630
24201413 HADI Muhammad: Since you want to demonstrate examples of how this agent-tech AI could be used in non-programming fields.

317
00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.759
Simon Wang: So maybe we could.

318
00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:58.720
24201413 HADI Muhammad: Do a demonstration of how it can…

319
00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:06.450
24201413 HADI Muhammad: you know, analyze data, for example, create a CSV file of, like, names and salaries or whatever, like.

320
00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:13.159
24201413 HADI Muhammad: used to be done in Excel manually can be done by the agent

321
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:18.380
24201413 HADI Muhammad: by one single prompt, I guess that could be a good demo as well.

322
00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:25.990
Simon Wang: to, create a CSV out of… Auto for what?

323
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:28.540
24201413 HADI Muhammad: So, like, give,

324
00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:36.540
24201413 HADI Muhammad: bunch of untidy data, like random noise or whatever, and then ask the agent to make a…

325
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:42.630
24201413 HADI Muhammad: a properly formatted CSV file, like it's done in Excel.

326
00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:43.720
Simon Wang: Okay.

327
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:49.649
Simon Wang: Yeah, so I think that's data cleaning, right? Which is,

328
00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:55.149
Simon Wang: Which is also relevant. But let's do a quick demo here.

329
00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:03.960
Simon Wang: We have a, PDF. Okay, so this is actually a, a, very fresh new book.

330
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.809
Simon Wang: And it's open access for about 2 weeks.

331
00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:14.979
Simon Wang: And Samantha Crow is someone I actually worked with before, so I kind of know her.

332
00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:22.600
Simon Wang: Right, so… so, what do we do with this PDF?

333
00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.580
Simon Wang: Now, what we do is basically say,

334
00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:37.429
Simon Wang: This is the PDF. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, AI agent won't be able to read the PDF, so we'll just say write a Python

335
00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:39.000
Simon Wang: For when?

336
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:40.470
Simon Wang: to convert.

337
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.290
Simon Wang: the PDF into… Markdown.

338
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:54.250
Simon Wang: And we could also say, but I'm not sure how… How, mmm…

339
00:38:55.250 --> 00:39:00.850
Simon Wang: well, it can perform this, but I can copy this… content.

340
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:09.140
Simon Wang: And, say, split the markdown.

341
00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:16.550
Simon Wang: File into several ones, based on… the TOC.

342
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:17.770
Simon Wang: Attached.

343
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:19.760
Simon Wang: Alright?

344
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:28.940
Simon Wang: So… I mean, this is a pretty, practical task, in the sense that

345
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:40.550
Simon Wang: now we are… we have to collaborate with AI, but AI cannot read PDF directly, so we asked the agent to write an ad hoc

346
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:44.109
Simon Wang: Python program to convert the PDF into

347
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:52.679
Simon Wang: markdown, but then the markdown would include over 70 pages, but we want to

348
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:59.140
Simon Wang: you know, just split them into several files, because maybe Divide and Conquer, I want to…

349
00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:04.750
Simon Wang: you know, read a one chapter or something, right? So I just go ahead and…

350
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:07.420
Simon Wang: And, provide that insertion.

351
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:30.290
Simon Wang: Yeah, and that's an example of how we are using AI agent to deal with PDF. But of course, in the process, we also write a little bit Python program, but I wouldn't really… I wouldn't really call it vibe coding. It's like… it's just kind of write a very little

352
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:40.219
Simon Wang: tool to do a conversion job, right? It's nothing significant or remarkable.

353
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.770
Simon Wang: Yeah.

354
00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:47.579
Simon Wang: So, so they create this Python…

355
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:54.420
Simon Wang: And, they run this, but, before they run it, they have to, like…

356
00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:58.910
Simon Wang: They have to install something.

357
00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.150
Simon Wang: Okay?

358
00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:07.790
Simon Wang: But see, now, we got the… Sprint markdown.

359
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.390
Simon Wang: But, apparently, they didn't do a very good job.

360
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:19.929
Simon Wang: Let me see…

361
00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:35.569
Simon Wang: So, I think… I think this is… this is where, the… the… I mean, this may not be a very good example, because apparently, there's something…

362
00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:42.200
Simon Wang: That is not… Because… because… let me… let me double check.

363
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.670
Simon Wang: Introduction…

364
00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:00.200
Simon Wang: Exterminating.

365
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:17.260
Simon Wang: Data privacy… So, I, I, I, I, I'm not sure, it, it seems that…

366
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:26.659
Simon Wang: Because, you see, they, they, they, they got this, but then introduction is only this, so apparently that's not quite right. Let's, let's give…

367
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:33.519
Simon Wang: the chapel another chance. But it seems like, at the very minimum, it does cover…

368
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.110
Simon Wang: All the pages here, which is great.

369
00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:42.590
Simon Wang: So, the split doesn't work very well. So, let's give it another chance, okay?

370
00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.940
Simon Wang: So… the split.

371
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.579
Simon Wang: Did not work.

372
00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:58.459
Simon Wang: Well… Please check… And maybe we should give them a little bit more hints

373
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.410
Simon Wang: And, we need to understand the structure a little bit better.

374
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:10.610
Simon Wang: So something like… Oh, actually, the introduction only got one page.

375
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.209
Simon Wang: Is that right?

376
00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:17.450
Simon Wang: Okay…

377
00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:26.740
Simon Wang: So maybe it's not that bad at all?

378
00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.030
Simon Wang: Introduction file.

379
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.500
Simon Wang: is near empty.

380
00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.350
Simon Wang: Not much.

381
00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.530
Simon Wang: here, either.

382
00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:02.300
Simon Wang: But of course, I mean,

383
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:08.229
Simon Wang: When you have… when you do this kind of feedback and everything, that means the tool is not…

384
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.400
Simon Wang: that mature.

385
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:15.410
Simon Wang: But I'm trying to kind of, like,

386
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:25.979
Simon Wang: get a… trying to solve a practical problem, so… I really don't mind, you know, trying to… Okay, so what we can do is say, ask…

387
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:29.240
Simon Wang: The chatbot to look at this.

388
00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:35.029
Simon Wang: Table of content. So, pay attention.

389
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:38.139
Simon Wang: to the… Page number.

390
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:39.490
Simon Wang: Thanks.

391
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:46.089
Simon Wang: Okay, and, double check, and see whether the page number is correct.

392
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.560
Simon Wang: Yeah, the patient number is correct.

393
00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:57.389
Simon Wang: So that means, you know, basically it's a less than 50 pages of book. It's a very small book.

394
00:44:58.810 --> 00:44:59.880
Simon Wang: short book.

395
00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:17.939
Simon Wang: And actually, this is another power of AI Agent, is that, it, when it receives, feedback, it, it can…

396
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:20.209
Simon Wang: Trying to solve the problem.

397
00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:21.300
Simon Wang: Right?

398
00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:39.270
Simon Wang: And this is just one example of how AI Agent can deal with a piece of text.

399
00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:44.049
Simon Wang: Right? Of course, this text is a bit long, we're talking about over 70 pages.

400
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:53.090
Simon Wang: But then, usually, a research article is something like, 30 pages or something, right?

401
00:45:53.570 --> 00:46:02.630
Simon Wang: In my workshop at PolyU, I actually use an, review article.

402
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:07.840
Simon Wang: So, I could potentially use a review article.

403
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:10.920
Simon Wang: Let me just,

404
00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:17.149
Simon Wang: I remember there's a scoping review.

405
00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:31.110
Simon Wang: There's actually a lot of review articles on this.

406
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:35.679
Simon Wang: Oh, this is for medication.

407
00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:47.459
Simon Wang: So, a scoping review on how to generate artificial intelligence form assessment in higher education.

408
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.010
Simon Wang: So, this could be…

409
00:46:52.390 --> 00:47:00.880
Simon Wang: a review article, and in this case, we're not dealing with PDF now, we are dealing with HTML,

410
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:05.580
Simon Wang: So, I can simply… Copy and paste the whole thing.

411
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:19.540
Simon Wang: Right? And That's also a pretty common… Case, and then… I'm going to put… a new…

412
00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:24.209
Simon Wang: Is this 2025?

413
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:25.960
Simon Wang: Don't really matter.

414
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:37.369
Simon Wang: Okay, so I got a whole paper here.

415
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.149
Simon Wang: Oh, it's actually 2024.

416
00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:43.950
Simon Wang: As you said, it doesn't really matter that much.

417
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:47.580
Simon Wang: But let me try to fix this.

418
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.979
Simon Wang: We'll do a rename.

419
00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:00.879
Simon Wang: Okay, now we have… We have a literature.

420
00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:09.850
Simon Wang: which is, a scoping review, then what can we do? You know, what can we do with this scoping review?

421
00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:14.880
Simon Wang: I mean, obviously, we can…

422
00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:21.100
Simon Wang: we can ask it for summary, right? But, since we are…

423
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:29.249
Simon Wang: We don't want to just do a simple task that a chapel can do, right? So we need to come up with something a little bit more sophisticated.

424
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:39.730
Simon Wang: So what are we gonna do is, we will create… less… studies.

425
00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:43.130
Simon Wang: Markdown.

426
00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:59.600
Simon Wang: Is it better now?

427
00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.080
Simon Wang: Yeah, I think it is better now.

428
00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:08.860
Simon Wang: Great.

429
00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:16.229
Simon Wang: Okay, so let's, let's, let's work on this a little bit.

430
00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:22.139
Simon Wang: Okay, so… so what we could do… let's focus on here.

431
00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:31.470
Simon Wang: Again, we copy this pass, And we say, please. Read.

432
00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:50.680
Simon Wang: this review article… by Shaw… And identify all the studies being reviewed, and update… this file.

433
00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:59.500
Simon Wang: For each study, you find… locate.

434
00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.140
Simon Wang: the comments.

435
00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.960
Simon Wang: from the… Review article.

436
00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:17.859
Simon Wang: and put them… into a reasonable… Set of groups.

437
00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:25.670
Simon Wang: Okay? So… This is another instruction.

438
00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:30.970
Simon Wang: And… You see?

439
00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:41.049
Simon Wang: We are trying to… Ask AI Agent to perform tasks that typically would be a research assistant.

440
00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:42.680
Simon Wang: would do it.

441
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:43.820
Simon Wang: Right?

442
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:52.380
Simon Wang: But again, it can be challenging, because we are not sure

443
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:56.229
Simon Wang: How well it can do the job.

444
00:50:56.910 --> 00:51:00.389
Simon Wang: And that's actually something we need to kind of,

445
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:07.000
Simon Wang: figure out, we have to be careful. Because…

446
00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:16.460
Simon Wang: the AI agent can perform fairly sophisticated tasks, because, as you can see here, in order to do this…

447
00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:19.710
Simon Wang: You have… they have to read this paper.

448
00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:26.080
Simon Wang: But then, they also need to, locate or identify all the…

449
00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.369
Simon Wang: All the studies being reviewed, because it's a scoping review, right?

450
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.419
Simon Wang: And then try to put them into categories.

451
00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:39.780
Simon Wang: Okay.

452
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:53.469
Simon Wang: I mean, of course, you can also do that by copy and paste… paste it somewhere, but now, with this AI agent, you can… you don't have to copy and paste.

453
00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:59.150
Simon Wang: But then… Beyond that, we still have to, kind of.

454
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.750
Simon Wang: I mean, we can think of something even more sophisticated, some other task.

455
00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:13.690
Simon Wang: Which is something you guys can… Can think about, you know, in your context, So anyway,

456
00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:25.240
Simon Wang: during the Friday workshop, I need to come up with… You know, this kind of…

457
00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.699
Simon Wang: This kind of,

458
00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.380
Simon Wang: use case.

459
00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:45.500
Simon Wang: So… Now we have group 1, student academic integrity and Cheating Concerns.

460
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:50.530
Simon Wang: We have Group 2 is feedback and self-assessment.

461
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:56.000
Simon Wang: And group 3, and Group 4, and Group 5, and Group 6, okay?

462
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:10.049
Simon Wang: I mean, of course, this needs to be validated, so if any of you have time tomorrow.

463
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.320
Simon Wang: Maybe you can help me validate this.

464
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:24.649
Simon Wang: And of course, we can also send this over to a different chatbot for validation, right? We can go to poll.com and ask for validation. Now.

465
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:40.210
Simon Wang: There could be another performance we can do, something like, okay, please draw… a mermaid… Diagram.

466
00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.330
Simon Wang: to visualize.

467
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:44.639
Simon Wang: this studies.

468
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:48.300
Simon Wang: In a new file.

469
00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:58.749
Simon Wang: But then we have to install Some kind of extension.

470
00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:04.530
Simon Wang: something like Mermaid.

471
00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:14.900
Simon Wang: Because… Otherwise, even when… they… write the mermaid codes.

472
00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:18.530
Simon Wang: You won't be able to… Read it.

473
00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:25.160
Simon Wang: Okay, anyway, that's the first…

474
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:32.730
Simon Wang: part of the… of the introduction. Well, I mean, I… during… during the, the, the workshop.

475
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:41.609
Simon Wang: the trick for the first part is to try to impress the audience, but I do believe it's quite impressive.

476
00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:49.599
Simon Wang: Anyway, it's already an hour, so let me… let me finish, now, the second part…

477
00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:57.350
Simon Wang: The second part is actually to introduce a… existing tools, okay?

478
00:54:57.930 --> 00:55:01.889
Simon Wang: Because Lead Study is another repository.

479
00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:06.779
Simon Wang: Which… Wait, I don't think I have…

480
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:13.550
Simon Wang: Oh, I see. See, the thing is… When we,

481
00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:19.160
Simon Wang: fork this repository. They won't fork any, like…

482
00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:24.560
Simon Wang: They won't fork this kind of,

483
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:29.160
Simon Wang: embedded one. So, actually, we have to go back.

484
00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.770
Simon Wang: And, find that late study.

485
00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.590
Simon Wang: So, let's, let's leave a note.

486
00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:44.690
Simon Wang: I'll try to finish in about half an hour, okay? And then you guys can… can decide.

487
00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:51.569
Simon Wang: If you want to, okay, so now…

488
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:56.290
Simon Wang: There's the file… wait a minute, it's an MD, right?

489
00:55:57.050 --> 00:56:02.090
Simon Wang: It's an MD, but then how can I… How can I,

490
00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.940
Simon Wang: visualization.

491
00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:17.780
Simon Wang: So what you can… what I can do is I could potentially…

492
00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:31.899
Simon Wang: I think… Hold on, hold on just one second. Because I only figured out how to use this.

493
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:38.770
Simon Wang: Hmm.

494
00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:31.410
Simon Wang: Because I was actually expecting…

495
00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:41.830
Simon Wang: I was expecting, like… some kind of…

496
00:57:58.810 --> 00:57:59.630
Simon Wang: Hmm.

497
00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:10.690
Simon Wang: Okay. How about this? Draw some… Create some simple… Black.

498
00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.910
Simon Wang: and white.

499
00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:24.540
Simon Wang: Let's try this.

500
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:40.070
Simon Wang: Anyway, my point is, we can actually ask the agent to write some code to visualize something, right? To draw some diagrams.

501
00:58:55.590 --> 00:59:02.480
Simon Wang: Okay, so now we have this…

502
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:12.970
Simon Wang: New code, but again, we have to… install the… preview…

503
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:46.260
Simon Wang: Okay, so now, once you got…

504
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:50.509
Simon Wang: This preview, you will be able to see

505
00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:57.109
Simon Wang: This is the more, kind of, visualized… version, right?

506
00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:03.140
Simon Wang: So, now we'll be able to… Draw some pretty cool…

507
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:06.180
Simon Wang: lines, and I mean, I mean diagrams.

508
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:09.770
Simon Wang: to… Visualize.

509
01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:12.900
Simon Wang: Okay.

510
01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:22.619
Simon Wang: Well, I mean, you can always… Go to a chatbot.

511
01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.670
Simon Wang: and asked the chatbot to write this kind of codes.

512
01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:34.369
Simon Wang: And then you go to another place to copy and paste the codes, and then you can also get this kind of diagrams, right?

513
01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:43.750
Simon Wang: But, when we are doing this, In an integrated development environment, Then everything can come together.

514
01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:45.900
Simon Wang: Right.

515
01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:51.590
Simon Wang: So that's… That's the whole point of the Of doing this.

516
01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:59.790
Simon Wang: Now, the next part is actually…

517
01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.390
Simon Wang: I want to…

518
01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:17.119
Simon Wang: I want to clone this thing, okay? So I have to clone this.

519
01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:23.150
Simon Wang: And this is a very important point.

520
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.900
Simon Wang: Because when you use AI Agent, you don't want to start from scratch.

521
01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.989
Simon Wang: You want to leverage existing codes.

522
01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.290
Simon Wang: Right?

523
01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:39.790
Simon Wang: So I con this repository to this folder.

524
01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:43.620
Simon Wang: And tell me how this would work.

525
01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:49.459
Simon Wang: and prepare a demoplan.md.

526
01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:52.730
Simon Wang: Right?

527
01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:59.589
Simon Wang: So now you, you, Clone this repository.

528
01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:08.829
Simon Wang: And of course, if you want to learn more about repository, you can read here.

529
01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:24.540
Simon Wang: So, it offers 5 main features. Extract metadata from scientific documents sourced from various locations, blah blah blah…

530
01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:34.100
Simon Wang: Actually, I haven't, I haven't, looked at… looked at this very closely, so if any of you,

531
01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:38.200
Simon Wang: could help me. If you have time tomorrow.

532
01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:44.460
Simon Wang: It has to be tomorrow, right? Because I need to finalize everything tomorrow night.

533
01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:52.459
Simon Wang: But, as you can see here, I provide the instruction, ask.

534
01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:56.630
Simon Wang: To travel to clone the repository,

535
01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:59.700
Simon Wang: And then tell me how this would work.

536
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:04.540
Simon Wang: And prepared a demo, plan. So…

537
01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:13.279
Simon Wang: the chatbot would… I mean, the agent would read through the entire repository, And the repository has been…

538
01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:15.149
Simon Wang: Cloned here.

539
01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.420
Simon Wang: And then create a comprehensive demo plan.

540
01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.339
Simon Wang: And this will take a little while.

541
01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.680
Simon Wang: Alright.

542
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:32.260
Simon Wang: And hopefully, We'll figure out how this whole thing would work.

543
01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:37.100
Simon Wang: And, you know, it can create some value.

544
01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.539
Simon Wang: for… For the user.

545
01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.900
Simon Wang: But, the most important thing is…

546
01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:56.870
Simon Wang: Even if you do not have that much of, programming background.

547
01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:01.569
Simon Wang: Now you can very easily clone any repository.

548
01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:12.139
Simon Wang: from GitHub, a lot of them open source, high quality, you know, Excellent work done by… Selfless people.

549
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:25.050
Simon Wang: I remember there's another keyhub It's called, like, paper… turn to…

550
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:31.900
Simon Wang: slides, or something, or paper turns to… Podcast or something.

551
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:42.990
Simon Wang: Alright, so, you see, you can turn paper into… Slides…

552
01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:50.850
Simon Wang: But then this is not… it's only 10 stars, so not necessarily very good. I… I remember there's a… there's a couple of other…

553
01:04:51.350 --> 01:05:01.870
Simon Wang: repository, which we can very, very briefly mention. I mean, there are a lot of repositories out there in GitHub that can support our scholarly work, okay?

554
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:11.270
Simon Wang: But then going back here, I guess I would just… Focus on this one.

555
01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.600
Simon Wang: And you see, now they've got a plan.

556
01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.160
Simon Wang: Where's the plan?

557
01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.630
Simon Wang: See, now we got a demo plan.

558
01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:36.259
Simon Wang: It says, show 5 main features… Extract filters, statistics…

559
01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:39.860
Simon Wang: I mean, it's just copy from the README,

560
01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.750
Simon Wang: So the demo plan is to install this first.

561
01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:46.879
Simon Wang: We have a study list, list of studies.

562
01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:51.280
Simon Wang: We're going to ex- export references.

563
01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.359
Simon Wang: Search and download.

564
01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:55.450
Simon Wang: and create a CSV.

565
01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:03.890
Simon Wang: Okay, so, great. Let's… Execute.

566
01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:05.600
Simon Wang: step.

567
01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:07.930
Simon Wang: 1.

568
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:10.840
Simon Wang: Face one.

569
01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:42.470
Simon Wang: Now, in order for this thing to work, they will have to… Do a lot of, installing, right?

570
01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.929
Simon Wang: See, before AI Agent.

571
01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:54.300
Simon Wang: if you want to run this whole thing, you need to open up another AI chatbot somewhere.

572
01:06:54.620 --> 01:07:09.410
Simon Wang: And whenever… you will get a lot of complaints, right? A lot of complaints from the terminal saying, this hasn't been installed, that hasn't been installed, then you have to copy and paste, you got a lot of, you know, instruction. But now,

573
01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.720
Simon Wang: It's all done… autonomously.

574
01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:21.619
Simon Wang: And, here, it says events not found, so that means there's something wrong.

575
01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:29.090
Simon Wang: But then the chapel would… I mean, the AI agent would try to figure it out.

576
01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:36.160
Simon Wang: Any questions so far? Any comments?

577
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:57.600
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: Our best in the presentation, Leisure.

578
01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:14.300
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: Mainly mentioned that, yes, it can take large amounts of data in, because if we're using this for research purposes, specifically non-programming, like you're… like, that's what the whole thing is about, then you should mention that, it can take in large amounts of data at once.

579
01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:17.770
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: And be able to look over and help you with this.

580
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:20.770
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: That would be one of the main qualities.

581
01:08:22.109 --> 01:08:23.229
Simon Wang: Yeah, you're right.

582
01:08:24.009 --> 01:08:30.659
Simon Wang: Because if, there's just, dealing with one… file at the time.

583
01:08:30.759 --> 01:08:33.789
Simon Wang: Then, you can always copy and paste, right?

584
01:08:36.409 --> 01:08:39.009
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: That's a good point. I'm, I'm, I'm.

585
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:46.289
Simon Wang: Maybe in the introduction part, I need to… I need to… showcase how…

586
01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:51.409
Simon Wang: By writing one line of instruction, The agent can handle…

587
01:08:51.849 --> 01:08:56.009
Simon Wang: Maybe 10 files simultaneously or something, right?

588
01:08:57.149 --> 01:09:16.619
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: Maybe you should start off by, like, yeah, like you said, that, like, it can handle 10 files at once, because most other AI agents are not powerful enough for that. You can also say that there's no exact limit to how much texting could be put, because you can see that there's no compliment, there's no exact thing, but usually other AI agents have that.

589
01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:20.969
Simon Wang: Well, in order for this to work.

590
01:09:21.319 --> 01:09:23.550
Simon Wang: We have to be very careful.

591
01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:29.609
Simon Wang: Because there's always this limitation about the context window, right?

592
01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:36.149
Simon Wang: So, what we could do is say, ask AI agent to…

593
01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:41.550
Simon Wang: Handle one file at a time, and generate some kind of output, and put it in a file.

594
01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:47.310
Simon Wang: And then continuously updating the file, one file at a time.

595
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:53.309
Simon Wang: and eventually we will have something. And that something is like an aggregate of

596
01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:59.620
Simon Wang: Processing all the files can be then… you know, Take to the next step.

597
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:02.500
Simon Wang: So… I think the…

598
01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:12.730
Simon Wang: the key power of AI Agent is not just to handle multiple files, but also to execute multiple steps in an instruction file.

599
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:17.190
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: Yeah, you should totally mention that, that is really a good feature.

600
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:23.130
Simon Wang: I think I… I need to build some… kind of…

601
01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:31.310
Simon Wang: more convincing use case, because the one that I demonstrate tonight, you know, some of them are not completely…

602
01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:34.539
Simon Wang: Kind of, smooth working.

603
01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:40.690
Simon Wang: So, we'll see, I think I… I could probably…

604
01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:48.239
Simon Wang: edit this a little bit. And if any of you have got time tomorrow, have some good ideas.

605
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:54.089
Simon Wang: Feel free to, you know, spend some time on this, and

606
01:10:54.230 --> 01:10:57.959
Simon Wang: And let me know, okay? Let me know if you got something.

607
01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:03.819
Simon Wang: But I still want to…

608
01:11:03.970 --> 01:11:07.929
Simon Wang: try and see how this whole lit study thing would work.

609
01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:14.850
Simon Wang: and maybe I can demonstrate this. You know, that there are some other repository…

610
01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:19.550
Simon Wang: That I can demonstrate as well. But then the third…

611
01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.889
Simon Wang: The third part of this demo is new use cases.

612
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:32.910
Simon Wang: And this is where I would… Probably invite some… participants…

613
01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:35.839
Simon Wang: To come up with some new ideas.

614
01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:46.109
Simon Wang: But, again, that… That would be…

615
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:54.170
Simon Wang: Hopefully, by the time they've done the first two parts, They will have some… Good ideas.

616
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:55.060
Simon Wang: Right.

617
01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.500
Simon Wang: So, what do you think?

618
01:12:07.650 --> 01:12:09.070
N24216883 NADEEM Muhammad Ahmad: Hey, Simon.

619
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:09.690
Simon Wang: Yep.

620
01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:14.970
N24216883 NADEEM Muhammad Ahmad: I just wanted to discuss, what we've, summarized today here.

621
01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.869
N24216883 NADEEM Muhammad Ahmad: So…

622
01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:26.539
N24216883 NADEEM Muhammad Ahmad: You talked about a whole bunch of things here, so I kind of did get lost in between it all, so I just want to kind of confirm it with you.

623
01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.030
Simon Wang: Right. So…

624
01:12:28.330 --> 01:12:40.389
N24216883 NADEEM Muhammad Ahmad: we're going to be delivering this workshop at HKU, and we're supposed to, you know, introduce the idea that, okay, HGNTech AI can be used for purposes other than vibe coding to

625
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:50.019
N24216883 NADEEM Muhammad Ahmad: you know, carry out more simpler tasks, like, for example, if you throw a PDF into an IDE, you can just write some English and, you know, get your task out of the way.

626
01:12:50.090 --> 01:13:06.519
N24216883 NADEEM Muhammad Ahmad: Now, what I'm struggling with over here, in terms of my understanding, is that you have a lot of directories already put into the repo, so that can get a little bit distracting, you know, especially as someone who hasn't seen the codebase developed from the ground up, right?

627
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:12.019
N24216883 NADEEM Muhammad Ahmad: Right. So, what I was thinking is maybe we start off with, you know.

628
01:13:12.650 --> 01:13:21.839
N24216883 NADEEM Muhammad Ahmad: less directories to kind of get people into the swing of things. And then maybe, you know, move towards a directory that already has all of the folders in it.

629
01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.210
Simon Wang: Right.

630
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:38.409
Simon Wang: That's a good idea. I agree that for someone who is completely new to this whole thing, having too many files and folders or folders in what we call the code space.

631
01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:45.329
Simon Wang: Our codebase can be, overwhelming and, intimidating and confusing.

632
01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:57.259
Simon Wang: So… But then at the same time, we do need some kind of… Files to work with.

633
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:06.469
Simon Wang: So, I would say… We should definitely… Streamline this a little bit.

634
01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:14.699
Simon Wang: Because… We need to get to the bottom of this.

635
01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:26.300
Simon Wang: And… like… step back and ask the very basic question, like, what exactly can this AI agent do?

636
01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:31.430
Simon Wang: For someone who… who's not going to do vibe coding?

637
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:34.930
Simon Wang: Who just needs to… Right.

638
01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:36.950
Simon Wang: papers, right?

639
01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:51.149
Simon Wang: I would say… The… A really good starting point is still review article.

640
01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:59.280
Simon Wang: And I think at some point, I actually demonstrated that, right? There's a scoping review, and I…

641
01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:08.409
Simon Wang: Sent this whole review article as a markdown file to the AI agent, and the AI was able to

642
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:17.560
Simon Wang: process the text and… and put, put them into categories. But, of course.

643
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:29.490
Simon Wang: I mean, this can also be done in a chatbot, right? So you can copy and paste the entire paper to a chatbot, and the chatbot can probably

644
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:34.820
Simon Wang: Categorize something for you.

645
01:15:35.670 --> 01:15:39.550
Simon Wang: But,

646
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:48.769
Simon Wang: again, at the operational level, what AI Agent was able to do is to perform actions like read and write.

647
01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:56.890
Simon Wang: And also read and write multiple files, and read and execute multiple lines of instructions.

648
01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:03.409
Simon Wang: I mean, that… that's… that's there, which I believe is very powerful, very promising.

649
01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:08.589
Simon Wang: But, we kind of need to…

650
01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:20.839
Simon Wang: sharpen our use case here. I mean, we got our use case, but as you said, you know, if there are too many subfolders and everything, it can be confusing, so we need to really, kind of.

651
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:30.960
Simon Wang: Sharpen our focus, and ensure that whatever use cases that we can demonstrate, it will be super…

652
01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:38.890
Simon Wang: Impressive, and also super clear in terms of what it can be done.

653
01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:42.209
Simon Wang: does that make sense?

654
01:16:44.210 --> 01:16:44.910
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: Yeah.

655
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:55.170
Simon Wang: I think at the end of the day, it's… It's all about, conversion.

656
01:16:55.460 --> 01:17:03.690
Simon Wang: You know, how can we convince more people To pick up this tool, and make it…

657
01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.849
Simon Wang: As part of their daily workflow.

658
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:15.830
Simon Wang: In fact, what I'm going to do is I will… Put this entire transcript

659
01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:26.620
Simon Wang: you know, to AI, and ask AI to generate some new ideas for me, and see if there might be some interesting, use cases.

660
01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:38.230
Simon Wang: Any, any other… so, so I think we're going to end here very soon, because I got another meeting at 9.30. So, you guys have any quick, final thoughts?

661
01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:46.249
Simon Wang: And also, if anybody would like to work on this tomorrow, just in case you got a few hours to work on tomorrow.

662
01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:51.479
Simon Wang: You know, this is a good time to share your ideas.

663
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:24.840
Simon Wang: Anyone?

664
01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:36.479
Simon Wang: Anyone got, some time tomorrow?

665
01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:38.060
Simon Wang: You can help me?

666
01:18:42.170 --> 01:18:47.780
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: How about to, like, sharpen what exactly this can do, or…

667
01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:55.300
Simon Wang: Yeah, cause, as, Arma mentioned earlier, we, we do need to…

668
01:18:56.530 --> 01:19:01.000
Simon Wang: We do need to kind of,

669
01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:08.399
Simon Wang: Sharpen the focus a bit, and clean up the… Folder bit, as well.

670
01:19:09.730 --> 01:19:11.679
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: I can help out if needed.

671
01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:16.410
Simon Wang: Great, yeah, do… Cuz…

672
01:19:19.710 --> 01:19:23.850
Simon Wang: I think… I think you can create a… a new branch.

673
01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:25.270
Simon Wang: of this.

674
01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:30.919
Simon Wang: And, you can work on it, and later on, you can issue, issue a,

675
01:19:31.670 --> 01:19:39.159
Simon Wang: a pull request, and I will probably create a sub-branch to, like, backup these files.

676
01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:44.410
Simon Wang: This one is not working, but…

677
01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:02.910
Simon Wang: Right, so, and also in terms of open-ended use case.

678
01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:05.260
Simon Wang: If you guys have any ideas.

679
01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:10.449
Simon Wang: I mean, it's okay if you don't have time tomorrow, no worry, because…

680
01:20:10.630 --> 01:20:15.869
Simon Wang: you know, Friday workshop is not the only workshop we're gonna run, there will be more workshops.

681
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:23.030
Simon Wang: So… but, Just… Because…

682
01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:26.980
Simon Wang: again, as I said, it would be, like…

683
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:30.000
Simon Wang: You are all end users, right?

684
01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:31.940
Simon Wang: The workshop is not just

685
01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:43.130
Simon Wang: run for them, for those research students at Hong Kong U is also for you, right? You're undergraduates, you have a different kind of, needs.

686
01:20:43.890 --> 01:20:54.739
Simon Wang: And, and, everything. So… so, just… Think about, how… The whole thing can change.

687
01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.449
Simon Wang: The way you study.

688
01:20:58.850 --> 01:21:06.140
Simon Wang: And, in fact, you may… You may be, you know…

689
01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:14.679
Simon Wang: you may be the devil's advocate, right? You may say, hey, I don't think it's going to work, right? Just… just tell me.

690
01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:18.290
Simon Wang: Tell me why you, you, you, you think it may not work.

691
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:26.330
Simon Wang: Installed, 7 data loading…

692
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:36.800
Simon Wang: create a CSV file from the study list, We already have…

693
01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:44.929
Simon Wang: Move to Phase 2… And so on and so forth.

694
01:21:45.650 --> 01:21:51.440
Simon Wang: So yeah, so Naina, if you can help tomorrow, why don't you come over to my office?

695
01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.999
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: Yeah, I'll be there for the meeting, right?

696
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:55.230
Simon Wang: I'm sorry?

697
01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:57.550
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: I'll be there meeting, I think.

698
01:21:58.410 --> 01:22:03.260
Simon Wang: Yeah, so we can, we can talk a bit, because, tomorrow I got…

699
01:22:03.370 --> 01:22:08.540
Simon Wang: I got 11.30 class, so we can meet probably 9.30 or 10, yeah?

700
01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:10.139
Naina Manoj RAMCHANDANI: Yeah, I can come on there.

701
01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:16.260
Simon Wang: Great, so… Great, so yeah, thank you again for your time. We are…

702
01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:25.129
Simon Wang: going to end now, but, I will send you the video, and, do have some thoughts on,

703
01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:30.359
Simon Wang: I mean, I mean, on Friday, you don't have to… I won't invite you to talk.

704
01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:35.299
Simon Wang: Unless, if you have something you only share, maybe during the open-ended…

705
01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:50.559
Simon Wang: session apart, you can talk. But otherwise, your main job is just to help out, and to answer any questions that, the other people may have. So you do need to kind of go through all this operation by yourself.

706
01:22:50.670 --> 01:22:55.640
Simon Wang: So you know, how this will work, and, and then,

707
01:22:57.820 --> 01:23:02.700
Simon Wang: Yeah, so… so hopefully you can… you can help others a bit.

708
01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:03.920
Simon Wang: Great.

709
01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:13.909
Simon Wang: Thank you, and I will see you on Friday. Now, for Friday, I will send you a…

710
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:17.410
Simon Wang: address at Hong Kong Yu.

711
01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:24.670
Simon Wang: We're gonna meet at 6.15,

712
01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:28.349
Simon Wang: We're gonna meet at 6.15 there.

713
01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:39.500
Simon Wang: Because the workshop will start at 6.30, so just a little bit earlier. You probably want to get some sandwich or an early…

714
01:23:39.850 --> 01:23:41.129
Simon Wang: meal.

715
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:47.409
Simon Wang: And I think, most of the restaurants, canteens at Hong Kong Yu would require Hong Kong Yu

716
01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:55.330
Simon Wang: Identity card, so that means, you probably won't be able to eat there, so you need to plan ahead.

717
01:23:56.010 --> 01:24:05.190
Simon Wang: Yeah, so, okay, so thanks again, I will see you on Friday.

718
01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.700
Simon Wang: Bye bye!

719
01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:11.439
tszwai: Thank you.
