businesses create targeted campaigns, improve customer segmentation, 
and develop innovative marketing tactics (Pillai & Sivathanu, 2020). As 
AI technologies continue to advance, their influence on marketing 
grows, opening up new possibilities for companies to interact with their 
customers in ways previously thought impossible. However, despite 
these advancements, AI adoption in marketing is not without its chal-
lenges, particularly concerning ethical issues and data privacy concerns, 
which need to be carefully managed.
1.2. The challenges of AI adoption
While AI presents immense opportunities for marketers, its adoption 
and integration into business practices are influenced by several factors, 
as stated in Table 1 below. One of the key considerations for organiza-
tions is their capacity to adopt and scale AI technologies. Perceptions 
regarding the security and privacy of customer data, as well as the 
complexities of integrating AI systems into existing infrastructure, often 
present significant barriers (Pillai & Sivathanu, 2020). For businesses to 
successfully implement AI, they must not only invest in the necessary 
technological tools but also foster an organizational culture that sup-
ports innovation and continuous learning. These challenges become 
more pronounced when considering the varying levels of AI readiness 
across industries and the complex nature of AI solutions that may 
require significant retraining of staff and restructuring of marketing 
processes (Kaggwa et al., 2023).
Furthermore, ethical concerns surrounding AI in marketing are 
substantial. Issues such as algorithmic bias, data privacy, and trans-
parency in AI decision-making continue to dominate discussions in the 
field (Ho et al., 2022). As businesses collect vast amounts of consumer 
data to fuel AI-driven marketing strategies, ensuring that this data is 
handled responsibly and ethically becomes increasingly critical. These 
concerns have spurred regulatory actions aimed at protecting consumer 
rights and have prompted businesses to adopt more transparent and 
accountable AI practices. While AI’s potential to revolutionize market-
ing is undeniable, addressing these ethical and regulatory challenges is 
crucial for its successful and sustainable adoption (Kumar et al., 2023).
1.3. The Role of AI in shaping business strategies
AI is more than just a tool for enhancing marketing efforts; it has 
become a strategic driver of business transformation. As organizations 
seek to differentiate themselves in the market, AI provides a competitive 
advantage by enabling more efficient decision-making, better customer 
targeting, and enhanced customer experience management. AI’s ability 
to process large datasets and provide actionable insights is revolution-
izing how businesses understand consumer behavior and make strategic 
decisions (Ghani et al., 2022). By predicting market trends and customer 
preferences, AI helps businesses optimize their strategies in real time, 
improving operational efficiency and increasing their ability to antici-
pate customer needs. The strategic value of AI extends beyond 
customer-facing functions and impacts various aspects of business op-
erations (Keegan et al., 2024). As businesses increasingly integrate AI 
into their operations, it becomes essential to understand not only the 
technical capabilities of these systems but also their implications for 
organizational culture and structure. For companies to realize the full 
potential of AI, they must cultivate an AI-ready culture that prioritizes 
innovation, upskilling employees, and adopting a mindset of continuous 
improvement (Kaggwa et al., 2023). As AI continues to shape the future 
of marketing, businesses must embrace its transformative power while 
navigating the complexities it brings.
2. Purpose of the review
This review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the 
complex and evolving landscape of AI-driven marketing. By focusing on 
both the technical and strategic aspects of AI adoption, the paper pro-
vides a detailed analysis of how organizations can successfully integrate 
AI into their marketing practices while addressing the challenges and 
opportunities that accompany such integration.
2.1. Scope of the Review
The primary objective of this review is to explore the multidimen-
sional aspects of AI in marketing. It focuses on three key themes that 
serve as the foundation for understanding AI’s role in marketing: tech-
nological infrastructure, ethical challenges, and organizational readi-
ness. These themes guide discussion and create a structured framework 
for analyzing the various elements that influence AI adoption and 
implementation in marketing. The first theme, technological infra-
structure, explores the critical requirements for effectively imple-
menting AI in marketing strategies. This includes the hardware, 
software, and data infrastructure necessary to support AI applications. 
Cloud computing, data storage solutions, and AI system integration are 
discussed as vital components for businesses to overcome integration 
challenges and ensure the optimal functioning of AI technologies within 
existing marketing processes (Penikalapati et al., 2023). The second 
theme, ethical challenges, addresses the growing concerns surround-
ing data privacy, algorithmic biases, and the transparency of AI 
decision-making. As AI becomes a more integral part of marketing, 
businesses must ensure that their use of AI aligns with ethical standards 
and fosters consumer trust (Du & Xie, 2021). Lastly, organizational 
readiness focuses on how businesses can cultivate an AI-ready culture. 
This involves investing in employee training, leadership, and strategic 
planning to ensure that AI adoption aligns with the company’s broader 
goals. Organizational readiness is critical to ensure that AI technologies 
are successfully integrated across departments and that employees are

equipped to work with AI systems effectively (Zada et al., 2023).
2.2. Research gaps and opportunities
While there is a growing body of research on AI in marketing, several 
key areas remain underexplored, particularly regarding how businesses 
can operationalize AI. This review identifies several research gaps in the 
current literature, particularly in understanding the best practices for 
integrating AI into marketing workflows, decision-making structures, 
and customer relationship management. Although the benefits of AI in 
marketing, such as increased efficiency and personalization, are widely 
recognized, further research is needed to explore how businesses can 
successfully operationalize AI to enhance their marketing strategies 
(Ledro et al., 2023). In addition, the ethical implications of AI remain a 
topic of concern, with questions regarding bias, transparency, and 
consumer trust continuing to emerge in the discourse surrounding AI 
adoption. While previous studies have touched upon the ethical chal-
lenges of AI, more research is needed to develop clear frameworks and 
guidelines that businesses can follow to ensure ethical AI deployment 
(Chintalapati & Pandey, 2022). Research into how different industries 
approach AI adoption and the specific challenges they face in doing so 
will also be important to understand in advancing AI-driven marketing 
practices. The findings from this review not only contribute to the 
existing literature on AI in marketing but also offer valuable insights into 
future research. The review identifies several promising areas for future 
exploration, including the integration of emerging AI technologies such 
as machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive ana-
lytics into marketing strategies (Akter et al., 2023). As AI continues to 
evolve, businesses will need to stay informed about the latest advance-
ments and adapt their marketing practices accordingly.
3. The evolution of AI in marketing
In their research, Abdullah et al. (2023) pointed out that the con-
ceptual foundation of AI marketing is based on the suggestions and 
application of predictive modeling in related decisions. This also em-
phasizes the need to use AI, whereby data can be processed, and 
high-target marketing can be accomplished. Marketing AI assists in the 
identification of the consumer’s preferences and behaviors, thus 
enhancing the probability of the various marketing strategies yielding 
positive results (Ameen et al., 2021). Recommendations that are ob-
tained from customer data increase customer satisfaction and may also 
increase the rate of sales (Purnomo, 2023). Another essential issue is the 
proper ethical concerns of marketing and AI. Frank et al. (2023) opine 
that marketers should get an elaborate, holistic understanding of the 
inputs to Artificial intelligence and their roles. That is why it is critical to 
avoid such absolute decisions as discrimination or violation of the rights 
to personal life. From the ethical point of view regarding AI in mar-
keting, there is more focus on the aspect of responsibility; further, the 
specifications of AI tools that need to be employed effectively shall 
address facts about the fairness and privacy equation that respects 
consumer secrecy (Du & Xie, 2021). Nevertheless, numerous questions 
exist about the outcome of the company’s AI proposals to purchasers and 
how they are implemented for consumers. Relevant issues and con-
straints by implementing AI in the context of marketing and the nature 
of how AI suggests and recommends would shift the consumers’ be-
haviors and perceptions (Puntoni et al., 2021).
3.1. Current state of AI in marketing
Today’s trends in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in marketing symbolize 
a new era in the marketing discipline, and it will surprise many to know 
that people are already calling it the fourth industrial revolution (see 
Table 2 below). This revolution constitutes a significant leap in para-
digm and approach toward marketing operations (Bahoo et al., 2023). 
AI is a critical factor in the individualization of advertising and 
marketing automation, but has also expanded into such sectors as neu-
romarketing, viral marketing, voice interface, and conversion rate 
optimization (Casado-Aranda et al., 2023). Al’s influence on marketing 
is profound and far-reaching, altering the nascent structure of the digital 
marketing environment in several vital ways. Within the scope of 
personalization, it eliminates the interaction level with customers that 
was impossible before. By utilizing machine learning with the help of 
algorithms and deep learning frameworks, marketers can create relevant 
marketing messages and appeals that are close to the customer’s pref-
erences and actions (Gupta et al., 2020). Personalization has gone a long 
way in enhancing customer interaction and satisfaction. AI continues 
transforming how it is used in viral marketing applications. Thus, AI 
algorithms can predict the content’s virality and help marketers create 
the likely shared campaigns (Huh et al., 2023). This capability is 
invaluable in today’s world, where social media has taken the marketing 
environment by storm, and often, the fate of a campaign can be sealed by 
executing a viral component. Another emerging field in AI applications 
is voice recognition technology, and the market is steadily growing. 
With the advancement in voice-assisted devices, marketers are now 
looking to capture the market through voice-activated interfaces (Xiao & 
Tan, 2024). This technology is revolutionizing how customers look for 
information and interact with brands. In the case of conversion opti-
mization, AI is essential in understanding a customer’s data and 
behavior when converting a lead into a customer (Soni, 2023). This 
includes website usability, individual customer interactions, and the 
positioning of the marketing communications. All these areas are within 
the industry, and intervention efficiency has been raised considerably 
regarding service quality, customer satisfaction, and employee-related 
results (Said, 2023). Numerous implementations of AI in this sector 
include digital recommendations for a better customer experience, using 
chatbots to answer customers’ questions, and using big data to forecast 
clients’ preferences and needs (Khatri, 2023). AI in marketing is not only 
restricted to the mentioned applications; it is a dynamic field where new 
usages and more advanced developments occur periodically. This shift 
in the mode of AI in real-life marketing makes it revolutionary; hence, AI

is the key to today’s marketing strategies (Kamal & Himel, 2023).
4. Factors influencing adoption and implementation
AI adoption in marketing is influenced by a variety of factors, both 
internal and external, which organizations must carefully navigate to 
ensure successful integration. One of the key influences is perceived 
benefits, where organizations view AI as a powerful tool to enhance 
efficiency, personalize customer experiences, and drive data-driven 
decision-making (Pillai & Sivathanu, 2020). For instance, AI can 
improve targeting precision in marketing campaigns by analyzing 
customer behavior and preferences, thereby increasing sales conversion 
rates (Puntoni et al., 2021). However, perceived risks often complicate 
the decision to adopt AI, especially concerning data privacy and secu-
rity. Many organizations are hesitant due to the fear of exposing sensi-
tive customer data to potential breaches, which could undermine 
consumer trust (Ledro et al., 2023). Another factor is organizational 
readiness, which includes the internal culture and resources available 
to facilitate AI implementation. A company’s technological readiness 
is crucial, whether it has the necessary infrastructure, like high-quality 
data storage and processing tools, to handle AI workloads effectively 
(Khatri, 2023). Furthermore, external factors, such as market compe-
tition and regulatory pressures, also play a significant role. Government 
regulations surrounding AI use push organizations to be more cautious 
in their approach to AI adoption (Rupp & von Grafenstein, 2024). 
External market trends, particularly rising customer expectations for 
personalized services, further motivate businesses to explore AI-driven 
marketing solutions (Ghani et al., 2022). These factors, when under-
stood and managed well, can pave the way for a smoother adoption 
process.
4.1. Technological infrastructure
The technological infrastructure required to implement AI in 
marketing is multifaceted, comprising both hardware and software 
components that must work cohesively. For practical AI applications, 
organizations must invest in robust data infrastructure. AI relies heavily 
on vast quantities of clean, structured data, and this data must be easily 
accessible for AI models to function optimally (Penikalapati et al., 
2023). This is where cloud computing and advanced data management 
systems come into action. Cloud storage services, for example, offer the 
scalability needed to store the large volumes of data processed by AI 
algorithms (Ionescu & Diaconita, 2023). In addition, the computing 
power required for AI tasks is significant. AI models, particularly those 
involving deep learning, need high-performing Graphics Processing 
Units (GPUs) for parallel processing, which accelerates the model 
training process and allows real-time predictions (Ajani et al., 2024). 
Companies must also consider data security in their infrastructure, as 
sensitive customer information is a core component of AI-driven mar-
keting strategies. Therefore, businesses must invest in secure, elastic 
storage solutions capable of processing vast amounts of data while 
maintaining integrity and privacy (Himeur et al., 2024). Moreover, the 
integration of AI tools with existing systems remains a significant 
challenge for organizations, especially when legacy systems are 
incompatible with modern AI technologies. This incompatibility can 
lead to data silos, where AI applications cannot efficiently share data 
with other business tools, impeding the full potential of AI in marketing 
(Merhi, 2023). Overcoming these integration barriers requires a 
well-thought-out strategy and significant investment in both new tech-
nologies and employee training to bridge the gap between old and new 
systems.
4.1.1. Hardware and software requirements
The critical dependency for practical AI applications in marketing is 
the technological platform. There must be a foundation with a high 
computational capacity to perform AI algorithms since these algorithms 
are generally tedious and time-consuming because of the large amounts 
of information the algorithms deal with (Himeur et al., 2024). To sup-
port these operations, businesses must invest in high-value equipment 
and hardware. Some of the significant components are high-performing 
GPUs, which are primary to machine learning and deep learning tasks 
because of their efficiency in parallel processing (Ajani et al., 2024). 
Besides the above, a dependable storage medium is also a crucial attri-
bute that must be incorporated in a modern hospital. AI solutions should 
be safe, elastic, and able to process vast amounts of data released and 
analyzed by artificial intelligence. Parallel to the further development of 
AI applications in marketing, faster data storage is also called for cloud 
storage services and high-speed databases (Ionescu & Diaconita, 2023). 
In the software propositions, the critical requirement is to make 
specialized AI and machine learning platforms available. These are the 
foundations on which all AI-driven marketing techniques depend since 
they facilitate the processing, analyzing, and interpreting of vast data 
collections. It is required that they should be flexible enough to 
accommodate various models of machine learning and different algo-
rithms, as well as the potential to connect to a range of sources such as 
customer database tools for tracking online behavior and market 
research data (Aljohani, 2023).
4.1.2. Integration challenges
Integrating AI technology into the current marketing systems poses 
challenges mainly because it requires significantly modifying the cur-
rent systems. The first concerns the integration conflicts between the 
newly implemented AI applications and the existing systems (Ledro 
et al., 2023). Most organizational structures still use systems that are 
incompatible with current AI solutions. This gap can culminate in sig-
nificant compatibility concerns to implement new systems, and it always 
presents challenges of overcoming the divergence of these two types of 
systems (Merhi, 2023). The excess of these sources can lead to another 
problem, that is, the formation of data silos. Another drawback 
emerging due to new AI tools is that, most of the time, such tools tend to 
work independently, not being connected to other databases and pro-
grams (Lee and Yoon, 2021). This can hinder the free flow of informa-
tion and the efficiency of AI applications in marketing. Thus, a more 
comprehensive approach to integrating systems is required to avoid such 
situations. AI integration in marketing systems implies using strategies, 
one of which is the attainment of stakeholder support. This entails 
showing that such technologies are worth the investment and that AI 
offers a return on investment.
4.2. Organizational culture
An organization’s culture plays a critical role in the successful 
implementation of AI, especially in marketing contexts where adoption 
is not merely a technological shift but a transformation in the way 
marketing teams operate. For AI to be successfully integrated, businesses 
must foster a culture that values innovation and learning. Employees 
need to feel confident that AI is a tool that enhances, rather than re-
places, their work (Zada et al., 2023). This shift requires leadership to 
promote an AI-ready culture actively, emphasizing continuous training 
and skill development (Chowdhury et al., 2023). Effective change 
management is also vital. Transitioning to AI-driven marketing stra-
tegies is often met with resistance due to concerns about job security or 
the complexity of new technologies (Tominc et al., 2024). Leaders must 
clearly communicate the long-term benefits of AI adoption, such as 
improved efficiency and the opportunity for employees to work on more 
strategic tasks rather than repetitive ones (Pappas et al., 2023). 
Furthermore, employee training is key to ensuring that staff at all 
levels are equipped with the necessary skills to work with AI technolo-
gies. This training should be tailored to different levels of expertise 
within the organization, from AI literacy for all employees to advanced

change, organizations can foster an environment where AI is seen as an 
asset, not a threat, driving both innovation and improved customer 
engagement strategies.
4.2.1. Change management
Going AI in marketing is not just a technological upgrade but a 
change in organizational culture (Allioui & Mourdi, 2023). This shift, 
therefore, requires strategic change management that plays a crucial 
role in managing change for the organizations to transition to AI mar-
keting. In this approach, additional emphasis is placed on training and 
involving employees to explain and ensure they understand the orga-
nizational AI implementation’s potential advantages and risks (Chan, 
2023). Leadership is considered a critical factor in this process. AI 
stakeholders must be able to convey AI’s usefulness to organizations, 
including their potential to provide organizations with more effi-
ciency/precision and improve human potential (Pappas et al., 2023). 
This includes demystifications of AI, for example, debunking myths like 
the notion of jobs being replaced by AI by effectively asserting that such 
tools reinforce existing human competencies (Haim, 2023). Organiza-
tional leaders must change the learning culture and perpetuate 
risk-taking and thinking about new technologies (Zada et al., 2023). 
Such a culture of constant training and change readiness is paramount to 
assuage and effectively unlock multiple opportunities in AI-infused 
marketing.
4.2.2. Employee training and skill development
The primary factor crucial for AI to integrate into marketing strate-
gies is a significant investment in the company’s employees and their 
training and professional growth (Chowdhury et al., 2023). The 
personnel have to be prepared in terms of technical skills to manage the 
AI tool and advanced and strategic skills to analyze the data interpreted 
from the AI and implement it into its marketing strategies (Miklosik 
et al., 2019). Training programs should thus encompass all the different 
aspects of a business and should be based on the different organizational 
skill levels. As of this writing, vital AI-related activities for all employees 
include AI literacy, which is the ability to comprehend the principles and 
possible applications of AI in occupational scenarios (Ray, 2023). 
Employee training should be given to the staff directly involved in AI 
activities; this should include data analysis, the application of machine 
learning models, and ethical considerations concerning the application 
of AI. Furthermore, constant learning or updating of skills is highly 
recommended, given that the field of AI has been dynamic throughout 
the years.
4.3. Data security and privacy concerns
The integration of AI in marketing involves numerous benefits, 
though the issue of data safety and security constitutes a set of compli-
cations fit for a separate discussion. In dealing with such challenges, 
organizations must adopt measures such as enhancing the level of se-
curity, ensuring that the protection of data meets set regulations, being 
transparent about the use of AI, being ethical in the use of AI, and 
adopting appropriate levels of investment (Ledro et al., 2023). Aware-
ness of these concerns is essential in applying AI in marketing and 
creating and sustaining consumer confidence in today’s digitized soci-
ety. Marketing professionals and AI manufacturers have realized many 
benefits of incorporating AI in their advertising approaches, but there is 
a significant issue relating to information protection (Allioui & Mourdi, 
2023). Marketing applications of AI in today’s world are primarily 
engaged with the understanding and analysis of large volumes of indi-
vidually sensitive data. These are the customer’s information, such as 
their age, purchasing behavior, activities on the internet, and personal 
preferences, which are significant in developing unique marketing 
strategies (Kamal & Himel, 2023). Nevertheless, managing such infor-
mation exposes the core of the AI system, including efficient algorithms 
and designs, to cyber risks and data leak hazards, which may 
significantly affect organizations and customers.
4.3.1. Expanded concerns in data security
As such, data security in AI-driven marketing encompasses its pro-
tection from unauthorized access and its firm’s data integrity and 
accessibility (Ni & Li, 2024). The nature of artificial intelligence systems 
and the importance of large data sets call for secure environments. 
Managers must ensure that their organization implements the most 
advanced security solutions, from encryption solutions to intrusion 
detection tools and firewalls. These measures must be kept changing and 
experimenting to respond to new cyber threats (Verma et al., 2024). 
Furthermore, the growing complexity of the AI algorithms used in 
marketing enhances the need to understand the consequences of data 
safety. For example, machine learning models may be susceptible to data 
poisoning and model inversion attacks, whereby the data or the model is 
manipulated to introduce faults. Safeguarding AI models is just as 
important as protecting the data that serves them (Habbal et al., 2024).
4.3.2. Privacy concerns and regulatory compliance
The privacy issue can easily be linked to Al’s marketing application 
data security. As AI systems obtain rich customer data and can analyze 
it, there is a higher probability that it will be used without respect for the 
client’s individualism if mishandled (Williamson & Prybutok, 2024). 
The attempts to meet the global requirements for personal data pro-
tection, including the GDPR in the EU, often become complex but 
essential. These regulations set out requirements on how any given 
personal data should be acquired, processed, and managed, and they 
also carry severe penalties in the event of non-compliance (Rupp & von 
Grafenstein, 2024). To ensure that the regulations are being met, there is 
a necessity for creating and implementing strict data governance pol-
icies in organizations. This includes asking for explicit and express 
authorization from a person before using their data, using as little data 
as possible, and providing explicatory information indicating the 
particular usage of this data (Karkoˇskov´a, 2023).
4.3.3. Transparency and ethical use of AI
There must be transparency in marketing automation through AI 
algorithms. Consumers are willing to know their data entitlement and 
are sensitive about how it is processed (Liu et al., 2023). Consumers need 
to understand if and how AI is being applied in marketing communi-
cation, how algorithms acting on their behalf work, and the choices they 
make based on their analysis of consumers (Allioui & Mourdi, 2023). 
There are also questions of trivia related to ethical dilemmas, such as 
bias and fairness in the AI model. One of the most critical considerations 
when designing and promoting AI marketing tools is to ensure that the 
tools do not have built-in biases and do not limit their service provision 
to particular categories of customers (Habbal et al., 2024). This neces-
sitates continually monitoring and assessing AI algorithms for equality 
and prejudice and adopting ethical AI policies.
5. Future directions and research opportunities
This paper establishes trends and proposes research directions since 
AI is gradually expanding. It also aims to indicate which areas of the 
ever-evolving relationship between AI and marketing should be 
explored further and what challenges should be addressed for future 
studies.
5.1. Emerging trends in AI and marketing
Artificial intelligence in personalization offers a new perception of 
the extent of marketing techniques, creating marketing appeals that are 
relevant and specific to the customers (Deryl et al., 2023). Though it 
ultimately results in customers having more influence over the product 
and possibly higher conversion rates, the implementation of this strat-
egy sparks immense ethical dilemmas (Wang et al., 2023). The use of 
M.R. Mohd Amin et al.

personal data and when the information should be processed for mar-
keting must be addressed in terms of privacy. In addition, if the markets 
get oversaturated with these personalized recommendations, they 
overburden or confine customers, thus making marketing campaign 
utilization ineffective (Reviglio, 2020). Voice conversational AI re-
defines the conversation between companies and customers with 
real-time engagement. This moves the companies away from 
old-fashioned customer communication towards a more effective and 
engaging approach (Bergner et al., 2023). Still, it becomes more work 
for marketers to control these artificial intelligence systems to deliver 
relevant and valuable customer information, retaining the brand’s tone 
and values. Failure to recognize user intent or vague replies may prove 
irritating and harm the brand image (Ahn et al., 2024). Moreover, AI is a 
powerful tool in predictive analytics that makes it possible to forecast 
consumer behavior and market trends to transform the marketing 
strategy (Godfrey & Price, 2023). It enables proactive decisions 
regarding marketing strategies to be made with better allocation of re-
sources and improvement of campaign outcomes. The problem lies in 
the predictive models’ reliability and the bias trend (Akter et al., 2023). 
The decision-making process may be based on unreliable information, 
which may affect the implementation of strategies for expanding 
cooperation and, conversely, may push customers away from a brand 
and harm its reputation.
5.2. Future developments in AI marketing
Looking ahead, the integration of AI in marketing will continue to 
evolve with the advancement of emerging technologies such as 5G, 
blockchain, and quantum computing. The enhanced capabilities of 
5G will allow AI to process large volumes of data instantaneously, 
enabling hyper-personalized, real-time customer experiences (Kamal & 
Himel, 2023). As AI integrates with blockchain, businesses will gain 
access to more secure and transparent customer data management, 
addressing growing concerns about data privacy and security in AI ap-
plications. In addition, quantum computing holds the potential to 
accelerate AI’s decision-making capabilities, making marketing cam-
paigns more adaptive and efficient (Penikalapati et al., 2023). Alongside 
these technological advancements, AI will also undergo significant 
ethical and regulatory transformations. The increasing demand for 
transparent, fair, and ethical AI will drive the development of AI 
governance frameworks that prioritize consumer privacy and the miti-
gation of algorithmic biases. This evolving regulatory environment shall 
compel organizations to ensure that their AI tools meet stringent ethical 
standards while safeguarding sensitive customer data (Chintalapati & 
Pandey, 2022).
Moreover, AI’s future role in sustainable marketing will become 
more prominent as businesses and consumers increasingly prioritize 
eco-conscious practices. AI will support organizations in optimizing 
supply chains, reducing waste, and creating environmentally-friendly 
marketing strategies, offering data-driven insights into consumer 
preferences for sustainable products (Jankovic & Curovic, 2023). 
AI-powered tools will empower companies to customize their marketing 
efforts to meet the growing demand for sustainability, fostering stronger 
engagement with environmentally conscious consumers. In addition, AI 
will enable the creation of autonomous marketing systems, capable of 
independently managing tasks such as pricing, content creation, 
customer segmentation, and engagement. These self-sustaining 
AI-driven systems will increase operational efficiency, reduce human 
error, and deliver highly personalized experiences at scale, revolution-
izing the way businesses approach marketing (Ledro et al., 2023).
5.3. Unexplored areas and future Research opportunities
According to Hicham et al. (2023), enhanced emotion and inter-
personal communication in both Artificial Intelligence and Emotional 
Intelligence are among potential possibilities. On the other hand, this 
brings to light some serious ethical questions about manipulating emo-
tions and the potential copyright of feelings and emotional data. While 
using AI in marketing, businesses need to exercise much caution so that 
the improved emotional intelligence will not compromise on ethics to 
give a better experience to customers (Guler et al., 2024). According to 
Hosseini and Mohammad (2023), AI marketing is mandatory in the 
modern interconnected market, but it is not without a series of concerns. 
It is important to note that many things are culturally sensitive in all 
countries. It is thus essential to be careful not to offend that culture 
intentionally. At the same time, due to the originality of cultural data 
depictions, an AI system must be trained with data from different cul-
tures, which is a significant challenge for marketers seeking to popu-
larize their products across borders (Baur & Iles, 2023). Sustainable AI 
marketing is consistent with the general societal trend whereby in-
dividuals focus on environmentally friendly practices. A key issue arises: 
how do marketers help create sustainable products/services and utilize 
AI for sustainable working processes in the systems (Jankovic & Curovic, 
2023). The study of the long-term impact of AI on consumer behavior is 
crucial for understanding how AI influences decision-making over time 
(Bernataviˇcien˙e, 2023). Marketers must consider the ethical implica-
tions of potentially shaping consumer behavior through AI-driven 
marketing tactics. The risk of reducing consumer autonomy could lead 
to a backlash against AI-driven marketing practices (Hermann, 2022).
5.4. Theoretical implications and contribution
This review paper synthesizes existing research on AI in marketing 
and offers several key theoretical implications and contributions. First, 
by exploring the connections between AI adoption and organizational 
readiness, this paper contributes to the expanding body of literature on 
technological adoption by highlighting how organizational culture, 
infrastructure, and human resources significantly impact the integration 
of AI in marketing practices, as asserted by Khanfar et al. (2024). While 
traditional Technology Acceptance Models (TAM) primarily focus on 
individual adoption (Davis, 1989), the findings suggest that 
organizational-level factors play an equally crucial role (Errida & Lotfi, 
2021). Second, this review challenges the traditional views of Innova-
tion Diffusion Theory (IDT), which typically views innovation adop-
tion as a linear process (Rogers, 2003). By examining the ethical and 
regulatory complexities surrounding AI in marketing, this paper pre-
sents a better view of AI diffusion, specifically, concerns about algo-
rithmic bias and data privacy significantly slow down the adoption 
process (Alhitmi et al., 2024). This insight adds a new dimension, sug-
gesting that external regulatory forces may be as influential as internal 
innovation attributes (Park et al., 2025). With the concept of an AI-r-
eady culture, which has not been sufficiently integrated into past 
theoretical models of marketing adoption, this paper reveals that busi-
nesses that cultivate an innovative, AI-friendly environment are better 
positioned to leverage the full potential of AI technologies, thus offering 
a new theoretical pathway for future studies (Cadden et al., 2022).
While this paper sheds light on various theoretical dimensions of AI 
adoption in marketing, several theoretical gaps remain. For instance, 
future research could delve deeper into how ethical concerns, such as 
data privacy, are integrated into existing technology adoption models 
(Du & Xie, 2021). Moreover, there is a need for more theoretical work 
that incorporates the role of leadership and employee skills in driving 
AI adoption, areas that remain underexplored in current frameworks 
(Tehrani et al., 2024).
5.5. Recommendations for future studies
The recommendation for interdisciplinary research highlights the 
complexity of AI in marketing, necessitating a blend of expertise from 
multiple fields. Future studies should not only focus on the technical 
aspects of AI but also delve into the psychological impact on consumers, 
ethical considerations, and the socio-economic implications of AI-driven 
M.R. Mohd Amin et al.

marketing strategies (Akter et al., 2023). The challenge in interdisci-
plinary research lies in integrating diverse methodologies and view-
points (Rane et al., 2023). Each field has assumptions and approaches, 
and reconciling them to develop cohesive and comprehensive AI mar-
keting strategies can be daunting. Furthermore, there is a risk that the 
focus on technical efficiency might overshadow ethical and psycholog-
ical considerations (Giebelhausen & Poehlman, 2024).
6. Conclusion
Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in marketing is a critical 
strategy for businesses pursuing competitiveness and relevance in the 
dynamic digital era. This comprehensive review has shed light on Al’s 
transformative influence in marketing, marking a shift from traditional 
methods to advanced, data-driven strategies. AI has revolutionized 
customer interactions by enabling marketers to gain deeper insights into 
consumer behavior, facilitating more personalized and effective mar-
keting strategies (Kamal & Himel, 2023). The enhanced efficiency and 
AI innovation reshape marketing processes, with AI proving to be a 
technological evolution and a strategic imperative. However, the 
journey towards AI integration in marketing is accompanied by chal-
lenges, including ethical concerns and data security, which concurrently 
offer opportunities for strategic growth and innovation. In addition, 
adopting AI necessitates significant changes in organizational structures 
and cultures, highlighting the need for an AI-ready culture and continual 
learning (Tehrani et al., 2024). Al’s integration has also synergistically 
merged with established marketing theories, enhancing traditional 
models and practices. Furthermore, creating an organizational culture 
that embraces AI is vital, fostering a mindset of innovation, experi-
mentation, and continuous learning. Staying current with the rapid 
evolution of AI technologies requires marketers to be informed about the 
latest developments and prepared to adapt their strategies accordingly 
(Ros´ario & Dias, 2023).
This review has achieved its objectives, as outlined in the previous 
section. Firstly, by examining the transformative role of Artificial In-
telligence (AI) in marketing strategies, this paper demonstrates how AI 
enhances customer engagement, decision-making, and operational ef-
ficiency. The findings validate the significant potential of AI in person-
alizing customer experience and optimizing marketing strategies, 
aligning with the first objective of this review.
Second, the review identifies several critical challenges organiza-
tions face when adopting AI in marketing, particularly in areas such as 
data privacy, ethical considerations, and infrastructure readiness. These 
findings directly address the second objective, emphasizing that over-
coming these barriers is crucial for AI’s successful integration into 
marketing practices. Lastly, this paper addresses the third objective by 
providing actionable recommendations for businesses to mitigate these 
challenges. By fostering an AI-ready culture, prioritizing employee 
upskilling, and developing ethical frameworks, organizations can navi-
gate the complexities of AI adoption. These insights highlight the 
importance of organizational readiness and ethical responsibility in 
ensuring the long-term success of AI-driven marketing strategies. Ulti-
mately, this review contributes to the literature by offering both theo-
retical perspectives on AI in marketing. It provides a comprehensive 
framework for organizations to adopt AI strategically while addressing 
ethical concerns, thereby positioning AI as a tool for sustainable growth 
and competitive advantage in the digital era.
