While Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) platforms like Chat GPT have gained significant traction in ed-
ucation, their specific applications for neurodivergent learners remain largely unmapped. Through systematic 
searching of academic databases and grey literature between 2020 and 2024, this scoping literature review 
examined the emerging landscape of Gen AI applications in supporting neurodivergent students (e.g., those with 
ADHD, autism, dyslexia, gifted, twice-exceptional) within K-12 educational contexts. Twenty-one relevant 
sources were identified, discussing Gen AI usage with neurodivergent students, the analysis revealed discussion of 
several predominant applications, including personalized learning, administrative assistance for educators, and 
development of individualized education plans. The review identified both promising approaches and significant 
concerns. Benefits included Gen AI’s potential to provide real-time, personalized support for students as well as 
reducing administrative burdens for educators. However, notable concerns emerged regarding information ac-
curacy, over-reliance on AI, privacy considerations, and the need for human oversight. The limited empirical 
evidence base was particularly striking, with only nine studies providing original research data. The review 
identified critical gaps in current understanding, particularly regarding Gen AI’s effectiveness across different 
neurodivergent conditions and curriculum areas, and little evidence of approaches detailed in ways that educators 
could use. This scoping review demonstrates the need for robust empirical research examining Gen AI usage in 
learning for neurodivergent students. These insights are timely and crucial for educators, researchers, and pol-
icymakers working to harness Gen AI’s potential in supporting neurodivergent learners within inclusive educa-
tional environments.
1. Introduction
The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) has 
transformed many sectors of society, with education experiencing 
particularly rapid adoption and change. Gen AI platforms, such as 
Chat GPT (Open AI), Claude (Anthropic), and Bard/Gemini (Google), 
have sparked intense interest among educators seeking innovative ways 
to support diverse learners. These platforms, which use Large Language 
Models (LLMs) to generate content in response to human prompts, 
present novel opportunities for personalizing education and supporting 
teaching practice (Lim et al., 2023).
The potential applications of Gen AI in education are particularly 
salient when considering neurodivergent students. Neurodiversity en-
compasses the natural variations in brain functioning that shape how 
individuals perceive, experience, and interact with the world (Hamilton 
& Petty, 2023). This includes, but is not limited to, students with autism, 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, dyscalculia, 
giftedness, and twice-exceptionality (gifted learners with disability).

Schools have traditionally struggled to fully accommodate neuro-
divergent learners, with educators often facing significant challenges in 
balancing appropriately differentiated instruction with broader class-
room demands (Kurth et al., 2018).
Recently there has been exponential growth in publications exam-
ining Gen AI’s educational applications, increasing by approximately 
175 % from 2022 to 2023 (Liu et al., 2024). However, amidst this bur-
geoning literature, to date there has been little systematic examination 
of how Gen AI might specifically support neurodivergent students in 
school. Understanding this intersection is crucial given both the rapid 
adoption of Gen AI in schools and the ongoing imperative to better 
support neurodivergent learners. As such this scoping literature review 
addressed four key objectives: 
1. Identify and analyze existing literature on Gen AI applications for 
supporting neurodivergent students in Kindergarten to Year 12 (K- 
12) educational contexts.
2. Examine reported uses of Gen AI by teachers of neurodivergent 
students.
3. Synthesize documented benefits and concerns regarding Gen AI use 
with neurodivergent students.
4. Identify critical gaps in current knowledge to inform future research 
directions.
Scoping review methodology is particularly appropriate for this topic 
given the emerging evidence base and the need to map a rapidly 
evolving and shifting field (Munn et al., 2018). By methodically 
exploring the intersection of Gen AI and neurodiversity in education, this 
review provides crucial insights for educators, researchers, and policy-
makers working to harness Gen AI tools and technologies to support 
inclusive education, especially for neurodivergent learners.
2. Background
2.1. Neurodiversity in education
Neurodiversity represents a paradigm shift from deficit models of 
human cognitive differences or disabilities (Hamilton & Petty, 2023). 
This neuro-affirming approach recognizes natural variations in human 
cognition that contribute to the diversity of human experiences and 
capabilities (B¨olte et al., 2021), whereas a disorder-focused approach 
concentrates predominantly on care and cure perspectives, dominated by 
medicalized views of disability (Ronksley-Pavia, 2015; Watson et al., 
1999). While it is necessary to achieve accommodations, adjustments, 
supports, and protection by disability discrimination legislation, the 
focus on disability tends to emphasize deficits rather than strengths 
(Baum et al., 2014; Ronksley-Pavia & Hanley, 2022). Neurodiversity 
refers to the natural variation in human neurological development and 
cognitive functioning, positioning neurological differences as part of 
natural human diversity, instead of medical disorders requiring cure or 
normalisation (Dwyer, 2022). From a neurodiversity perspective, neu-
rodivergent students possess different yet equally valid ways of thinking, 
doing, and learning, with challenges primarily arising from environ-
mental mismatches not inherent deficits (Jones & Orchard, 2024).
Neurodivergent students demonstrate unique patterns of strengths 
and challenges that impact their learning experiences (Kapp, 2020). For 
instance, students with dyslexia may excel in visual-spatial thinking, 
while 
experiencing 
challenges 
with 
text-based 
learning 
(Ronksley-Pavia, 2024). Similarly, gifted students might demonstrate 
exceptional abilities in specific domains, while requiring support in 
others, which is particularly the case for twice-exceptional students 
(Ronksley-Pavia, 2015).
2.2. Generative AI in education
Gen AI represents a significant advancement in educational 
technologies, distinguished by its ability to generate novel content in 
response to human prompts. Unlike other educational technologies, 
which principally provide pre-programmed content, Gen AI can engage 
in dynamic, iterative interactions to generate content in response to 
changing user input (Lim et al., 2023). This capability has led to rapid 
and uneven adoption in education, with its use increasing significantly 
since 2020 (Liu et al., 2024).
2.3. The intersection of Gen AI and neurodiversity
The convergence of Gen AI capabilities with the needs of neuro-
divergent learners present unique opportunities and challenges in 
educational settings. Gen AI’s potential to generate personalized content 
aligns with many of the evidence-based approaches for supporting 
neurodiversity, such as differentiated instruction, multiple means of 
representation, and individualized pacing (Baum et al., 2001; Bushie, 
2015; Morgan, 2024; Tomlinson, 2004). Additionally, Gen AI could 
potentially assist educators in developing and implementing personal-
ized learning strategies while reducing the administrative burden asso-
ciated with individualized support programs (Ronksley-Pavia & Bigum, 
2024). However, questions remain about how to use Gen AI in ways that 
enhance rather than replace human interaction, ensuring appropriate 
content generation, and maintaining necessary safeguards. Under-
standing the current landscape of Gen AI applications for neurodivergent 
students is crucial for informing future development and implementa-
tion of these technologies in inclusive educational settings. The effec-
tiveness of Gen AI applications may vary based on individual learner 
characteristics and approaches. Tu (2024) demonstrates that students 
exhibit distinct patterns in their conceptions and interactions with 
Chat GPT, with implications for how Gen AI models may be optimally 
configured for different learners. This finding has implications for neu-
rodivergent students, suggesting that they may also benefit from cus-
tomised Gen AI interactions. Though recent frameworks have 
established some foundational approaches for Gen AI integration for 
mobile learning (Lai & Tu, 2024) and identified variations in student 
interactions (Tu, 2024), there remains a gap in understanding how these 
applications can be specifically designed and implemented to support 
the unique requirements and strengths of neurodivergent learners.
3. Methods
The scoping review was conducted and reported in accordance with 
the PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews (PRISMA-Sc R) (Tricco et al., 
2018). The PRISMA-Sc R guidelines provide a standardised methodology 
for conducting scoping reviews, which is useful for mapping literature in 
new fields with emerging evidence. The protocol for this review was 
registered on the International Database of Education Systematic Re-
views (IDESR ID: IDESR000161). This registration process is considered 
a gold standard in evidence synthesis, which validates this approach to 
ensures methodological transparency.
3.1. Inclusion criteria
All article formats (e.g., journal articles, book chapters, blogs, pod-
casts, webinars) pertaining to the use of Gen AI with or for neuro-
divergent students in K-12 educational contexts were considered for 
inclusion. Articles were limited to those written in English and published 
between 2020 and July 2024. The year 2020 represents the time when 
the adoption of Gen AI in education accelerated, which is illustrated by 
the number of publications on Gen AI increasing by 22 % between 2020 
and 2021, then increasing by 114 % between 2021 and 2022, and by 
174 % between 2022 and 2023 (Liu et al., 2024).
3.2. Population of interest
The population of interest for the scoping review was neurodivergent

K-12 students (including preschool/kindergarten, primary/elementary, 
middle school, and secondary/high school). For this review, neuro-
diversity was used as an umbrella term encompassing a range of 
developmental conditions and experiences including, but not limited to 
autism, ADHD, sensory processing disorders, dyslexia, dysgraphia, 
dyscalculia, giftedness, twice-exceptionality, multi-exceptionality, or 
any combinations of such conditions (Mirfin-Veitch et al., 2020). Arti-
cles focusing solely on neurotypical students or students in tertiar-
y/higher education were excluded.
3.3. Topic
The topic of interest was the use of Gen AI in K-12 educational set-
tings to support neurodivergent students. Gen AI was defined as a tech-
nology that leverages LLMs (e.g., Chat GPT), to generate content (e.g., 
words, images) in response to human prompts (e.g., instructions, ques-
tions) (Lim et al., 2023). LLMs use deep learning algorithms to perform a 
variety of natural language processing tasks. Articles focusing on 
non-generative AI technologies (e.g., wearables, virtual/augmented re-
ality devices, speech/handwriting recognition, prediction models, ro-
bots), or virtual assistant technologies (e.g., Alexa, text-to-speech 
devices) were excluded. Any technologies integrating Gen AI (e.g., social 
robots integrated with Gen AI) were included to provide a comprehen-
sive overview of how Gen AI is being used to support neurodivergent 
students.
3.4. Search context
For the database search context, Gen AI must have been used in a K- 
12 educational setting. Articles applying Gen AI outside of these educa-
tional contexts or for a non-educational purpose were excluded (e.g., 
clinical diagnosis, recognizing emotions).
3.5. Information sources
Database searches were conducted in Education Database (Pro-
Quest), ERIC (IES), Psyc INFO (Ovid), Scopus (Elsevier), and Web of 
Science (Clarivate) on 19th July 2024. Additional searches were con-
ducted between 25th July to 30th July 2024 by means of forward 
searching (using Google Scholar’s cited by function), and backward 
searching (searching reference lists), through articles relevant to the 
topic. Relevant book titles and journals were also searched (see Sup-
plementary Materials for complete list of books and journals searched).
Searches for grey literature were conducted between 31st July to 2nd 
August 2024, including a database search (using the same search string 
from the main database search) for conference proceedings (Pro Quest 
Conference Papers Index) and dissertations (Pro Quest Dissertations and 
Theses database). Websites were also searched to identify any relevant 
article format (including, but not limited to blog posts, videos, webinars, 
posters, policy documents, educational resources, and guidelines) by 
using the website’s search function and applying the following keywords 
separately: “artificial intelligence”, “Chat GPT”, “neurodivergent”, 
“neurodivergent”, “autism”, “ADHD”, “special education”, “inclusive 
education”, “pedagogy”.
Searches included education department websites (e.g., Australian 
Government Department of Education, European Commission – Educa-
tion and Training), and educational research organization websites (e.g., 
National Center for Learning Disabilities, American Educational 
Research Association), as well as websites pertaining to educational 
technology (e.g., Ed Surge, Ed Tech), neurodivergent children (e.g., 
Autism Speaks, National Association for Gifted Children), and teaching 
resources (e.g., Resources for Teaching, MIT AI Hub). Online learning 
websites were also searched (e.g., Ted Ed, Khan Academy, Coursera, 
Ed X). See Supplementary Materials for the full list of sources identified 
and searched during grey literature searching. Adding parallel source 
information is standard practice in systematic and scoping reviews to 
ensure comprehensive coverage of the relevant literature (Rose et al., 
2020).
3.6. Description of search process
The search strings were developed in conjunction with Anthropic’s 
Claude Gen AI to provide an editable list of keywords relevant to the 
topic (see Supplementary Materials for prompts used and responses 
generated by Claude). This initial list was adjusted and additional key 
words/terms added by the research team. All terms relevant to the 
population (neurodivergent students), topic of interest (Gen AI), and 
context (K-12 education) were then combined into further search 
strings. A preliminary search was conducted in each database to gauge 
the breadth and relevance of initial search results. After scanning the 
search results in each database, the search strings were refined to 
exclude irrelevant terms and include relevant terms that were initially 
missed (e.g., chatbot). The final search strings applied during database 
searching are presented in Table 1. The strings pertaining to the popu-
lation, topic, and context were combined using the ‘AND’ and ‘OR’ 
Boolean operators in each database.
3.7. Screening and Selection
Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation, n.d.) software was used to 
manage the search results and streamline the screening process with 
article details held in Mendeley reference management software 
(Elsevier, 2024). All search results were imported into Covidence, which 
automatically removed most duplicate articles. Any missed duplicates 
were manually removed during the screening process. Prior to 
screening, the research team discussed and confirmed the eligibility

criteria (Table 2). The criteria were documented and distributed to each 
researcher involved in the screening process to minimise errors and 
ensure consistency. Four independent reviewers were involved in the 
title/abstract screening stage.
One reviewer screened 100 % of the results, and three reviewers each 
screened approximately 33 % of the results. There was strong consis-
tency between reviewers at this stage (95 % agreement). Subsequently, 
full-text screening was conducted independently by three other re-
viewers. One reviewer screened 100 % of the full-text articles, and two 
reviewers each screened approximately 50 %. Consistency between re-
viewers at this stage was also strong (95 % agreement). Discrepancies 
arose primarily from differing judgements regarding the extent to which 
an article focused on Gen AI and its use with neurodivergent students. 
These discrepancies were resolved through discussion of the eligibility 
criteria, subsequently articles generally focusing on Gen AI, with only 
brief mentions of neurodivergent students, were excluded.
4. Data collection
4.1. Data charting process
Data from all eligible articles were manually extracted and recorded 
in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet by one member of the research team. A 
pilot extraction of 10 articles was conducted to check that all relevant 
information was being collected. The list of data items was then refined 
to include additional relevant information (e.g., geographical location). 
The research team reviewed the spreadsheet for further refinement 
based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Table 3 provides a detailed 
overview of all data items extracted from the included articles.
5. Results and discussion
Responding to the first objective of the scoping review, the next two 
sections discuss the identification and analysis of the literature.
5.1. Identification of sources
A total of 4168 articles were obtained through database searching 
and an additional 24 articles were obtained from other sources (i.e., 
additional searching including grey literature). After duplicates were 
removed, titles and abstracts of the remaining 3035 articles were 
screened. Of these articles 108 were deemed relevant for full-text 
screening. Overall, 21 articles were included in the review. Fig. 1 pre-
sents the PRISMA flow diagram summarising the number of articles at 
each stage of the review.
6. Analysis of sources
Data were quantitatively and qualitatively synthesized and analyzed. 
The quantitative synthesis used descriptive analysis to present a clear 
overview of how the topic was approached (e.g., frequency of the 
different types of article formats included, type of study designs 
employed). Qualitative narrative and tabular synthesis allowed de-
scriptions of the literature in more depth, identifying Gen AI use with or 
for neurodivergent students in educational contexts, and highlighting 
gaps that warrant further research.
6.1. Characteristics of sources of evidence
Of the 21 articles included in the review, most were from North 
America (52 %), followed by Europe (24 %), then Asia (10 %) and 
Oceania (4 %), additionally, a small proportion of articles were based 
across both Europe and North America (10 %) (Fig. 2). There was a wide 
range of formats including online blogs (33 %), journal articles (29 %), 
book chapters (14 %), conference proceedings (9 %), as well as maga-
zines, podcasts, and webinar series (each 5 %) (Fig. 3). Few publications 
were confirmed as peer-reviewed (38 %); the remaining publications 
were either not peer-reviewed (e.g., podcast, webinar series), or their 
peer-reviewed status was unknown (e.g., blogs, magazines). While most 
articles discussed Gen AI use with neurodivergent students generally, 
some articles focused on specific conditions, such as autism, giftedness, 
dyslexia, and other learning disabilities (without specifying any partic-
ular ones), and twice-exceptionality.
Most articles discussed potential uses and/or benefits of Gen AI for 
neurodivergent learners; however, few articles (n = 7) presented 
empirical data on the actual use of Gen AI for these populations. Of these 
empirical articles, three described the design and usability of a Gen AI- 
based chatbot or social robot (i.e., Bertacchini et al., 2023; D’Urso & 
Sciarrone, 2024; Hajahmadi et al., 2024), two used quantitative 
methods to investigate the efficacy of using Chat GPT to develop IEP 
goals (i.e., Rakap, 2024; Rakap & Balikci, 2024), and two used quali-
tative methods to explore students’ (i.e., El Naggar et al., 2024), or 
educators’ perspectives of using Gen AI in classrooms (i.e., Seiradakis, 
2024). One study used mixed methods to examine the potential for 
Chat GPT to assess and provide feedback on student essays (i.e., Evme-
nova et al., 2024). Lastly, one technical paper demonstrated the po-
tential for Gen AI platforms to produce mathematical writing models to 
support student learning (i.e., Smith et al., 2024). Table 4 (empirical 
articles) and Table 5 (grey literature), provide summaries of the final 21 
articles included in the scoping review.
Different Gen AI platforms were identified across the articles, with 
many discussing multiple Gen AI tools. The most prominent platform 
mentioned in articles was Chat GPT (n = 18), followed by Bard/Gemini 
(n = 3), and Claude (n = 2) with one reference each to Bing (Microsoft), 
Notebook LM (Google), Mid Journey (Midjourney), DALL-E (Open AI), 
Briskteaching (Brisk), Curipod (Curipod), almanack.ai (Almanack), and 
a custom-developed chatbot. Some articles discussed Gen AI more 
broadly without identifying any specific platforms (n = 9).
Articles largely focused on Gen AI use in general K-12 education (58 
%), with an equal proportion of articles focusing specifically on early 
childhood (preschool and kindergarten), primary (elementary), and 
secondary education (14 % each). Additionally, some articles discussed

the use of Gen AI for specific school subjects and curriculum areas, for 
example, English (n = 2), Mathematics (n = 1), Languages (n = 1), and 
English and Humanities and Social Sciences (n = 1). However, most 
articles discussed Gen AI use in schools more broadly.
The following section responds to the second and third objectives of 
the literature review, namely the reported uses of Gen AI by teachers of 
neurodivergent students and any perceived benefits. Concerns regarding 
Gen AI use are then discussed.
6.2. Using Gen AI to support neurodivergent students
Various pedagogical approaches for using Gen AI to support neuro-
divergent students emerged from the articles, such as assessment, pro-
vision of feedback, personalized learning, and learning support 
opportunities. Our findings align with a broader framework proposed by 
Lai and Tu (2024), who identified three primary roles for Gen AI in 
educational contexts: tutor, tutee, and tool. Although not explicitly 
proposed for neurodivergent students, these roles could be useful in 
supporting neurodivergent learners. For example, as a tutor, Gen AI 
could potentially provide consistent, patient instruction without social 
pressure. As a tutee, students could practice explaining concepts at their 
own pace. As a tool, it may be useful as an adaptive interface that ac-
commodates different processing approaches and communication 
preferences.
6.3. Assessment practices using Gen AI
Using Gen AI to enhance assessment practices and provide feedback 
to neurodivergent students were examined in seven articles. For

instance, Gen AI was said to be able to generate practice questions or 
create examples for assessment preparation (Guilbault, 2023). These 
approaches align with differentiating assessment tasks to support indi-
vidual neurodivergent students’ strengths and areas for improvement, 
that were discussed in other articles (e.g., Hajahmadi et al., 2024). Such 
uses of Gen AI may support accommodation of the unique learning needs

for further development, tailoring the level of difficulty and content 
focus to match the learner’s current knowledge and skill level. Subse-
quently, any resource recommendations could be made based on per-
formance and any knowledge gaps that had been identified (Khazanchi 
& Khazanchi, 2024).
6.4. Provision of feedback using Gen AI
The potential for Gen AI to offer real-time, dynamic feedback, and 
fostering a responsive learning environment was also highlighted in 
three of the articles. Suggestions regarding feedback provision by Gen AI 
included personalized feedback to students and feedback to teachers on 
their teaching strategies (Khazanchi & Khazanchi, 2024). With reference 
to using Gen AI for constructive criticism, Khazanchi and Khazanchi 
(2024) suggested that Gen AI could highlight areas where improvement 
might be needed in assignments and teaching practices, offering specific 
suggestions and additional resources for reinforcing learning for both 
teachers and students.
Further suggestions for improving teaching approaches were with 
reference to Gen AI providing feedback to teachers on their pedagogical 
strategies, where Gen AI could be used to analyze real-time data from 
classroom practice, and offer immediate feedback, comments, and sug-
gestions to assist teachers in improving their teaching. Feedback on 
student learning was provided in the form of in-depth explanations of a 
variety of feedback capabilities of Gen AI, such as feedback on content 
understanding, writing and grammar, structure and flow of content, 
originality and creativity, critical thinking, adherence to rubrics, 
constructive aspects, prompting for revisions, and suggesting resources 
and references (Khazanchi & Khazanchi, 2024). However, authors 
acknowledged the potential drawbacks and ethical considerations of 
using Gen AI for feedback, emphasizing the need for responsible and 
ethical implementation, addressing issues such as data privacy, bias, and 
the potential for misleading or inaccurate content. Human oversight and 
judgment were deemed essential in ensuring that feedback practices 
were effective and equitable.
6.5. Personalized learning using Gen AI
Gen AI was noted to have potential in the personalization of student 
learning, tailoring learning to meet the varying individual needs of 
neurodivergent students. Fourteen articles specifically used the term 
personalized learning (e.g., Biscotti, 2023; D’Urso & Sciarrone, 2024; El 
Naggar et al., 2024; James, 2024; Khazanchi & Khazanchi, 2024), while 
three used similar terminology (e.g., Koh, 2023; Rakap, 2024; Sa˘gdıç 
et al., 2024), such as individualized learning (e.g., “individualized lesson 
planning”, "individualized education programs”), with the two terms 
being used interchangeably across nine articles. Gen AI’s potential to 
enhance student engagement and understanding by adapting or 
personalizing content based on students’ learning profiles, preferences, 
and strengths was emphasized in the majority of articles (n = 17). These 
17 articles discussed various approaches and technologies to implement 
personalized learning experiences for neurodivergent students, as well 
as benefits and challenges associated with implementation.
Approaches to leveraging Gen AI capabilities in personalizing 
learning included AI-powered adaptive learning tools. Bertacchini et al. 
(2023) suggested these tools could be used for personalizing instruction, 
such as adapting to pace and abilities, providing customized learning 
materials and assessments, and activities tailored to each student’s 
needs. Although specific examples were not provided or explored. 
Personalized learning approaches have broader implications for meeting 
the unique learning needs of twice-exceptional students and gifted stu-
dents, particularly in varying the pace to meet their needs, a key element 
of gifted education provision (Le Beau et al., 2023). Examples included 
text-to-speech and speech recognition technologies that were said to 
benefit students with specific learning disabilities like dyslexia, dys-
graphia, and dyscalculia. However, these examples are current practices 
for supporting neurodivergent learners, and in many instances it was not 
made clear exactly how Gen AI could be used in novel ways beyond these 
generic suggestions.
Concept mapping was suggested for supporting students with 
dyslexia by adapting dialogues and generating personalized concept 
maps, which visually represent the student’s knowledge structure, 
potentially minimizing reliance on textual explanations, which can be 
challenging for some dyslexic learners (D’Urso & Sciarrone, 2024). 
Similarly, for neurodivergent students with ASD, Sa˘gdıç et al. (2024)
emphasized the role Gen AI could play as assistive technology for 
personalizing education using a variety of high-tech AI-supported as-
sistive technologies, such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and 
eye-tracking technology, and their applications in enhancing commu-
nication skills, social skills, and independence. Although not specifically 
driven by LLMs, the advances in Deep Learning and LLM technologies 
had facilitated the creation of some of these AI-assisted assistive tech-
nologies (e.g., AI4LA-Artificial Intelligence for Learning Assistant) (D’Urso 
& Sciarrone, 2024). Similarly, James (2024) advocated for personalized 
learning through examples like Knewton, a learning platform using AI to 
provide adaptive learning paths, and Google’s Notebook LM that can 
support students in gaining faster insights by grounding language 
models, using their own documents. This would be useful for supporting 
talent development for students, particularly gifted students and 
twice-exceptional learners. These suggestions added depth to under-
standing of the potential of Gen AI beyond some of the generic ap-
proaches as suggested in other articles, although concrete examples of 
practices using Gen AI remained elusive across most articles.

alternative learning approaches by restructuring information into more 
accessible formats (e.g., converting text into interactive visuals), and 
providing scaffolding to support learning (Vosler, 2024). Overall, the 
articles provide limited discussion of scaffolding as a distinct approach 
facilitated by Gen AI in different ways than teachers had previously been 
using prior to the advent of Gen AI. However, four articles did emphasize 
the importance of structured support and breaking down complex tasks 
into smaller, manageable steps, which aligns with the principles of 
scaffolding (i.e., El Naggar et al., 2024; Evmenova, et al., 2024; Hajah-
madi et al., 2024; Seiradakis, 2024), which is crucial for supporting the 
learning of neurodivergent students. Pedagogical approaches that sup-
port task management (e.g., by breaking down complex tasks, such as 
chunking), and promote improved organizational skills (Larkey, 2023) 
align well with the learning needs of neurodivergent students, who, for 
example, may face significant challenges in developing and maintaining 
organisational skills. One example suggested to improve organizational 
skills using Gen AI was for teacher touse these tools to create a visual 
schedule or checklist for a student with ADHD struggling with organi-
zation (Larkey, 2023). The flow-on effect of enhanced organization 
means that students’ learning outputs are more likely to show what they 
know and can do (Biscotti, 2023). Furthermore, Larkey (2023) sug-
gested the importance of using clear and detailed prompts to ensure 
desired results, along with monitoring student interactions with Gen AI 
for 
safety 
and 
appropriateness 
and 
reviewing 
and 
editing 
Gen AI-generated content for accuracy, as AI can sometimes make mis-
takes, hallucinate, or make things up.
In some articles, Gen AIs were referred to as Chatbots (e.g., Chat GPT), 
and were viewed optimistically for enhancing communication skills and 
fostering confidence for neurodivergent students. This was seen as 
particularly important for students with ADHD and autism, where 
learners could practice and refine their communication skills without 
the social pressures and anxieties often associated with human interac-
tion (Bertacchini et al., 2023; Hajahmadi et al., 2024; Koh, 2023; Sa˘gdıç 
et al., 2024). Some individuals with autism were reported to have a 
preference for interacting with Gen AI robots over humans and this was 
thought to likely be as a result of the predictability and control offered 
by robot interactions (Sa˘gdıç et al., 2024). Hence these types of social 
interactions may be conducive to building communication skills and 
confidence for some neurodivergent students. El Naggar et al. (2024)
reinforced this through findings from their qualitative study, which 
examined the experiences of exceptional learners (e.g., gifted students 
and/or students with learning disabilities), who were engaged in 
AI-mediated discussions versus traditional classroom dialogues. The 
study revealed that participants expressed “apprehension about judg-
ment and social anxiety when communicating in a classroom setting as 
opposed to interacting with AI” (El Naggar et al., 2024, p. 147).
The potential for Gen AI to empower neurodivergent students was 
emphasized across 10 articles, with suggestions such as Gen AI’s poten-
tial to enable neurodivergent students in becoming active co-creators of 
their own learning experiences, rather than being passive recipients 
(Vosler, 2024). Adapting content and engaging with different learning 
materials (e.g., beyond text-heavy content), can potentially foster a 
more individualized and interactive learning journey (Koh, 2023; Seir-
adakis, 2023). Consequently, it was postulated across articles that this 
use of Gen AI may enrich neurodivergent students’ learning experiences 
by increasing their engagement, possibly leading to improved learning 
outcomes and greater enjoyment of learning (Khazanchi & Khazanchi, 
2024; Larkey, 2023; Seiradakis, 2024).

conditions in exploring applications of Gen AI. Given the conceptualiza-
tion of neurodiversity, that is, moving beyond identification of disabil-
ities and medicalized views of neurodiversity, (Dwyer, 2022; Jones & 
Orchard, 2024), it is interesting that some authors concentrated their 
discussion on individual conditions. Specifically, three articles explored 
using Gen AI with autistic students, two articles focused on dyslexia, 
while one other article focused on both autism and dyslexia. Another 
three articles explored Gen AI for supporting students with ADHD; one 
article discussed ADHD with learning disabilities, and another looked at 
ADHD and dyslexia. The majority of articles (n = 12) explored Gen AI use 
in other broader categories of neurodiversity (e.g., inclusive education, 
special education, gifted education, and for learning disabilities).
6.8. Supporting students with ADHD and autism
Metacognitive strategies were perceived by some researchers to be 
important for neurodivergent students’ learning, particularly for those 
with ADHD and/or autism (Biscotti, 2023; Sa˘gdıç et al., 2024), however 
the description of specific strategies leveraging Gen AI were often absent. 
Emphasis was placed on the ongoing need for interventions and 
educational approaches that go beyond addressing surface-level chal-
lenges, to specifically target underlying cognitive processes that often 
pose difficulties for neurodivergent learners, which is an area Gen AI 
could potentially assist with, although it was not clearly elucidated in 
many articles.
Some articles suggested that communication skills might be 
enhanced by Gen AI as many neurodivergent students (e.g., autistic 
students) may struggle with traditional forms of interaction, such as 
speaking (i.e. Bertacchini et al., 2023; Sa˘gdıç et al., 2024). Sa˘gdıç et al. 
(2024) indicated that Gen AI chatbots could support social learning 
through interactive simulations where social robots could serve as 
companions and educators, supporting autistic students to engage in 
more controlled environments, thereby reducing anxiety and allowing 
practice of skills (e.g., turn-taking and recognizing emotions). The 
design and usability of such technology was described by Bertacchini 
et al. (2023), who programmed and linked Chat GPT with a commer-
cialised social robot (called Pepper) to provide real-time dialogue and 
respond to simulated facial expressions. By simulating social in-
teractions, recognizing emotions, and offering individualized, adaptive 
communication, it was proposed that Pepper could have potential to 
support autistic students to practice verbal communication and social 
skills in a judgement-free and structured setting. Beyond communication 
skills, both articles (i.e., Bertacchini et al., 2023; Sa˘gdıç et al., 2024), 
emphasized the potential for Gen AI to offer personalization for autistic 
students by tailoring learning materials to accommodate and adapt to 
the needs and special interests of students. It was also posited that 
Gen AI-based technologies have the potential to facilitate greater inde-
pendence for autistic individuals, both within and outside educational 
contexts (Sa˘gdıç et al., 2024). However, this potential was not empiri-
cally explored in any of the articles we reviewed.
6.9. Supporting students with dyslexia
Two articles studied the design, usability, and effectiveness of chat-
bots to support English and Language learning for students with dyslexia 
(i.e., Evmenova et al., 2024; Hajahmadi et al., 2024). Challenges with 
phonological processing as well as word decoding, recognition, and 
comprehension are common issues for students with dyslexia, and are 
often compounded by difficulties in sequential information retention 
and working memory (Ronksley-Pavia, 2024).
D’Urso and Sciarrone (2024) introduced AI4LA, a custom-developed 
chatbot that analyzed students’ conversational data to model personal-
ized concept maps designed to support students with dyslexia to visu-
alize and structure knowledge, reducing reliance on text-heavy 
materials. Students reported that AI4LA was user-friendly, engaging, 
and effective in supporting their learning needs. Similarly, Hajahmadi 
et al. (2024) developed ARELE-bot, a social robot integrating both 
augmented reality and Chat GPT, creating an interactive learning envi-
ronment that focused on dyslexic students’ strengths in visual processing 
and memory. Conversations with a virtual teacher strengthened dyslexic 
students’ verbal communication skills, while offering visual dictionaries 
and semantic networks for better understanding and retention of lan-
guage learning. While the efficacy of ARELE-bot had not yet been tested, 
both AI4LA and ARELE-bot worked to reduce cognitive load by pre-
senting information in more visual formats, which may support the 
development of English and language learning skills for students with 
dyslexia (D’Urso & Sciarrone, 2024; Hajahmadi et al., 2024). Although 
both these bots had been paired with other AI technologies, and were 
not solely using LLMs.
6.10. Supporting gifted and twice-exceptional students
The use of Gen AI to support gifted students and twice-exceptional 
students was discussed across four articles (i.e., Besnoy, 2023; El Nag-
gar et al., 2024; Guilbault, 2023; Ronksley-Pavia & Bigum, 2024). 
Gen AI’s capacity to enhance brainstorming and creativity emerged as a 
crucial pedagogical tool across these articles, primarily through its 
ability 
to 
generate 
what 
was 
termed 
“adjacent 
possibles” 
(Ronksley-Pavia & Bigum, 2024),allowing ideas to be combined in novel 
ways beyond traditional cognitive constraints. This is particularly sig-
nificant in educational contexts because it enables both educators and 
neurodivergent learners to surpass conventional ideation limitations 
while maintaining student agency in the learning process. Gen AI tech-
nology could serve as a cognitive partnership that expands the bound-
aries of traditional educational discourse. This was evidenced in the 
ARELE-bot implementation (Hajahmadi et al., 2024) and the debate 
tournament (Guilbault, 2023), where AI-facilitated brainstorming 
generated real-time, contextually relevant ideas supporting higher-order 
thinking skills. Furthermore, when aligned with constructivist learning 
approaches, this capability could enable neurodivergent students to 
build knowledge through active exploration rather than passive recep-
tion, while simultaneously supporting their diverse learning needs and 
cognitive profiles.
Results from the literature suggest that Gen AI chatbots can create 
discussion-based activities, introduce novel ideas, and challenge gifted 
students by offering conversations at an appropriate pace and level (El 
Naggar et al., 2024). Additionally, Gen AI can support students to delve 
deeper into topics (e.g., through both extension and enrichment) beyond 
the standard curriculum, potentially fostering unique ideas and 
enhancing creativity (Ronksley-Pavia & Bigum, 2024). Gen AI may also 
offer dynamic, real-time feedback and prompts, creating additional ac-
tivities tailored to gifted students, thus supporting classroom engage-
ment (Guilbault, 2023). Another prominent theme across these articles 
was the potentiality of Gen AI to foster higher-order thinking skills, such 
as critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. For example, Besnoy 
(2023) emphasized Gen AI’s capacity to develop critical thinking and 
refine reasoning abilities by presenting diverse viewpoints. Similarly, 
Guilbault (2023) discussed how Gen AI could support learning in sub-
jects like history, and with skills like debating, by offering exercises and 
real-time activities designed to enhance critical thinking and 
problem-solving skills. Furthermore, each of these points was articu-
lated throughout a study conducted by El Naggar et al. (2024) who 
explored gifted students’ perceptions of AI-mediated learning in the 
United Arab Emirates. This study provides important empirical sub-
stantiation for understanding how gifted learners engage with and 
perceive Gen AI tools in educational contexts. The research underlines 
the technology’s capacity to provide personalized learning experiences, 
while acknowledging certain limitations, such as confirmation bias and 
potential information overload (El Naggar et al., 2024). However, 
further empirical research is warranted to investigate the effectiveness 
and identify additional ways in which Gen AI could be applied to support 
the educational experiences of gifted students and twice-exceptional 
M. Ronksley-Pavia et al.

students.
6.11. Supporting students with learning disabilities
Two articles discussed the use of Gen AI for students with learning 
disabilities (Evmenova et al., 2024; Smith et al., 2024). The study by 
Evmenova et al. (2024) used mixed methods to investigate the potential 
of Chat GPT to mark essays and provide recommendations for improving 
writing. While Chat GPT was generally found to be effective in grading 
assignments and generating feedback, it often produced excessive 
feedback, which may overwhelm neurodivergent students, some feed-
back suggestions were also misaligned with students’ grade levels and 
abilities. The study’s methodological rigor in examining both GPT-3.5 
and GPT-4 outputs demonstrated that despite explicit inclusion of stu-
dent characteristics in the prompts, that Gen AI consistently failed to 
differentiate its feedback across developmental stages and abilities. The 
researchers documented that suggestions provided for third-grade 
writing were fundamentally indistinguishable from those offered to 
seventh-grade students, indicating a concerning lack of developmental 
calibration in potential provision of useful feedback to students. Their 
findings emphasized how vocabulary use remained static across grade 
levels, with no meaningful modulation of linguistic complexity to match 
students. This finding emerged through systematic analysis of 
AI-generated responses where, despite being provided explicit infor-
mation about students’ grade levels, disability status, and English lan-
guage learner designations, the Gen AIs demonstrated minimal capacity 
to tailor their instructional suggestions appropriately. The comparative 
analysis of AI outputs across different student profiles, revealed that 
even when student characteristics were explicitly acknowledged in AI 
responses, this recognition rarely translated into meaningfully differ-
entiated instructional strategies. For instance, the study noted that stu-
dent characteristics were “merely acknowledged in some sets” 
(Evmenova et al., 2024, p. 8), with responses simply restating these 
characteristics without substantively incorporating them into the feed-
back’s content or approach. This limitation manifested particularly in 
cases where characteristics, such as grade level and specific learning 
needs, should have been used to inform the nature and complexity of the 
Gen AI-generated feedback (Evmenova et al., 2024). This developmental 
insensitivity represents a significant limitation in current Gen AI tools, 
suggesting the need for more sophisticated developmental calibration in 
future iterations of these tools.
Similarly, Smith et al. (2024) explored the use of Gen AI platforms 
(including Chat GPT, Bard, and Bing), in providing scaffolding and ex-
planations for mathematical problems. Although these platforms 
quickly generated information, the explanations were found to some-
times lack alignment with grade-level expectations and student needs, 
containing occasional inaccuracies. The findings from both articles 
highlight the necessity for human oversight and monitoring to ensure 
the quality and appropriateness of the support and feedback provided.
6.12. Complexities of neurodiversity that can impact on Gen AI use
The frequency of co-occurring or co-morbid conditions, such as 
ADHD and autism (Ronksley-Pavia, 2024), introduces additional 
complexity to supporting neurodivergent students. This necessitates 
carefully attuned pedagogical approaches that can simultaneously 
address multiple, interconnected diversities. It was posited in one article 
that well-designed Gen AI-enhanced educational tools should be used to 
support abilities as well as challenges, and when designed in ways that 
addressed both strengths and challenges, these tools have the potential 
to personalize learning for students with comorbid conditions 
(Hajahmadi et al., 2024). The multifaceted challenges of comorbidity 
underscore the necessity for sophisticated, multimodal intervention 
approaches that thoughtfully integrate Gen AI while maintaining sensi-
tivity to the emotional and cognitive needs of neurodivergent learners.
There is a delicate balance between leveraging technological 
affordances and maintaining essential human interaction elements in 
language acquisition (Hajahmadi et al., 2024). The risk of cognitive 
overload emerged as a significant concern across the reviewed litera-
ture, particularly when neurodivergent learners had to simultaneously 
process real-world and digital information streams. The imperative to 
align augmented content with specific learning objectives, while main-
taining engagement, presents ongoing challenges. The psychological 
and behavioral dimensions of these challenges warrant particular 
attention. Linguistic performance anxiety can manifest in detrimental 
mental blocks, potentially triggering a cascade of declining motivation 
and self-esteem (Hajahmadi et al., 2024). These emotional challenges 
often intersect with social and interactive difficulties, including atten-
tion maintenance in conventional learning environments and broader 
social perception challenges.
6.13. Using Gen AI to support educators working with neurodivergent 
students
Seven articles discussed the potential of Gen AI to alleviate the 
additional administrative burden faced by educators working with 
neurodivergent students. Many posited that Gen AI may assist special 
education teachers by automating administrative tasks such as paper-
work, grading, attendance tracking, and student reporting, thereby 
potentially freeing up more time for instructional planning and inno-
vation (Bickerstaff, 2024; Khazanchi & Khazanchi, 2024; Koh, 2023; 
Lieberman, 2023; Sa˘gdıç et al., 2024). Additionally, Gen AI may assist 
principals and school administrators by helping draft school policies, 
manage enrolment, registration, and scheduling, making educational 
management more efficient (James, 2024; Seiradakis, 2024). This ca-
pacity for administrative assistance may be particularly valuable for 
educators working in special education contexts, where paperwork and 
administrative duties can be especially onerous and time-consuming.
Beyond administrative tasks, most articles noted that Gen AI could 
support teachers in designing curricula for inclusive learning and 
generating educational content tailored to diverse learning needs. 
Gen AI’s ability to quickly generate materials was posited to enable ed-
ucators to create a variety of resources that align with different students’ 
interests, learning profiles, and unique needs (Bertacchini et al., 2023). 
Interestingly, learning styles appeared in some articles, which have been 
debunked as neuromyths (Hattan et al., 2024; Papadatou-Pastou et al., 
2021), yet these remained evident in some articles found in this review. 
This has the potential to perpetuate these (and other) neuromyths in 
education practice and perhaps should be addressed in the LLM training 
materials.
Eight articles highlighted Gen AI’s role in the IEP development pro-
cess, where it was used to assist with student skill analysis, individual-
ized planning, and to measure student progress, thus potentially 
reducing workload for teachers (Bickerstaff, 2024; Koh, 2023; Sa˘gdıç 
et al., 2024). Of these articles, two assessed the efficacy of Chat GPT in 
developing IEPs, specifically for students with ASD (i.e., Rakap, 2024; 
Rakap & Balikci, 2024). In both studies, special education teachers were 
randomly assigned to either a Chat GPT group (using Chat GPT) or con-
trol group (not using Chat GPT) and asked to develop 15 IEP goals each 
(3 goals for 5 students with ASD). Two independent raters evaluated the 
quality of the IEP goals. Findings from both studies revealed that the 
quality of IEP goals was higher in the Chat GPT group compared to the 
control group, with the Chat GPT group developing a higher proportion 
of goals in the communication and social domains, whereas the control 
group developed a higher proportion of goals targeting pre-academic 
and behavior domains (Rakap, 2024; Rakap & Balikci, 2024). The 
Chat GPT group also spent less time developing these goals compared to 
the control group (10 min less on average). These studies also empha-
sized teacher expertise and empathy as critical for effectively inter-
preting and applying the generated content, reinforcing the need for 
human oversight and involvement when using Gen AI tools.
Four articles explored how Gen AI could be used to provide both

instruction and feedback to students and educators. In terms of student 
feedback, studies such as Evmenova et al. (2024) found that while 
Chat GPT was effective in providing feedback on student essays, it often 
generated excessive amounts of information that was not always aligned 
with grade levels or specific student needs. Similarly, Gen AI platforms 
like Chat GPT, Bard, and Bing were found to offer explanations in sub-
jects such as mathematics but sometimes produced information that was 
inaccurate or inappropriate for the student’s current grade level (Smith 
et al., 2024). Discrepancies between feedback provided by educators 
and Gen AI may be due to educators providing more targeted and indi-
vidualized instruction using multiple forms of data and critical infor-
mation to make instructional decisions, rather than just the prompts 
provided to the Gen AI tools (Evmenova et al., 2024). The additional 
information included teacher professional judgment and knowledge 
about how each student’s background, culture, and language may in-
fluence performance, which allowed teachers to tailor feedback and 
instruction in ways that Gen AI may not yet be fully able to do. Moreover, 
in addition to student support, Gen AI may also offer potential for 
educator feedback by providing recommendations and coaching for 
professional development (Khazanchi & Khazanchi, 2024). Further-
more, Gen AI may enhance collaboration by facilitating communication 
between teachers, therapists, and parents, enabling alignment of 
educational activities with therapeutic goals and family expectations 
(Bertacchini et al., 2023; Bickerstaff, 2024). For instance, Bertacchini 
et al. (2023) suggested that therapists can use Chat GPT’s real-time 
feedback capabilities to adapt scenarios based on the child’s re-
sponses, maintaining therapeutic relevance. Educators can guide Gen AI 
to enhance learning experience, ensuring educational content is 
engaging and pedagogically appropriate, while parents provide critical 
insights into the child’s behaviour and preferences, helping fine-tune the 
responses made by Gen AI (Bertacchini et al., 2023). This dynamic 
interplay among professionals, supported by Gen AI, could promote a 
comprehensive and adaptive approach, ensuring that interventions are 
both effective and tailored to individual students’ needs.
In the synthesis of reported uses of Gen AI by teachers of neuro-
divergent students, a range of perceived benefits are apparent. The next 
section explores concerns from the literature review in regard to Gen AI 
use with neurodivergent students, the second aspect of objective three.
7. Concerns with use of Gen AI
The integration of Gen AI in education raises important consider-
ations regarding ethics, privacy, and effectiveness (Wang et al., 2024). 
Concerns about data security, accuracy of generated content, and 
so-called appropriate use of AI in educational settings have led to ongoing 
discussions about practices and guidelines for implementation (Bond 
et al., 2024; Dawson et al., 2019). These considerations are particularly 
pertinent when working with neurodivergent students to ensure that 
Gen AI use is ethical and has appropriate safeguards to protect privacy.
The literature revealed significant concerns regarding the accuracy 
of information generated by Gen AI, with 76 % of the articles high-
lighting the potential for misinformation or outdated content. This could 
be problematic in educational settings where inaccurate information 
may hinder student learning and development (Guilbault, 2023). 
Another common concern was the possibility of both educators and 
students becoming over-reliant on Gen AI. For teachers, relying heavily 
on Gen AI for feedback, assessment, and IEPs raises ethical and practical 
concerns about the quality and appropriateness of using AI-generated 
content. Bickerstaff (2024) suggested that educators should ensure 
Gen AI tools they are using align with educational standards, privacy 
protections, and fairness criteria in evaluations. Some authors argued 
that for neurodivergent students, excessive use of Gen AI may limit social 
interactions or impede cognitive development and learning (El Naggar 
et al., 2024; Sa˘gdıç et al., 2024). One study also identified the risk of 
Gen AI increasing the potential for plagiarism (Khazanchi & Khazanchi, 
2024), which is a commonly occurring concern across the broader Gen AI 
literature.
Ethical considerations emerged as an important issue, particularly 
with regards to privacy and data security. Nearly half (43 %) of the 
articles discussed concerns about the ethical and potential legal risks 
associated with sharing sensitive information on publicly accessible 
Gen AI platforms (e.g., Lieberman, 2023). However, some articles sug-
gested that anonymizing student data may assist in mitigating these risks 
(e.g., Bertacchini et al., 2023). Transparency was another key issue, as 
stakeholders, including students and their families, need to be informed 
about how Gen AI would be used in educational settings. This included 
the extent of Gen AI’s capabilities, as well as any limitations, ethical is-
sues, and privacy concerns (Bertacchini et al., 2023; Besnoy, 2023; 
James, 2024; Rakap, 2024). Moreover, five articles explicitly mentioned 
that lack of clear policies and evidence-based guidelines for the use of 
Gen AI in the classroom, highlighting the need for more research, 
guidelines, and responsible AI policies (Evmenova et al., 2024; James, 
2024; Khazanchi & Khazanchi, 2024; Lieberman, 2023; Seiradakis, 
2023).
Notably, there was implicit recognition in some articles about the 
value of metacognitive skills in teaching, where teachers needed to be 
aware of their own thought processes and decision-making when 
adapting Gen AI-generated suggestions for individual student needs, for 
example, when creating tailored lesson plans and IEP goals (Rakap, 
2024; Rakap & Balikci, 2024). Human oversight of Gen AI usage was 
deemed essential for teachers as experts in pedagogical reasoning as was 
use of their professional judgements (Bickerstaff, 2024; Evmenova et al., 
2024; Khazanchi & Khazanchi, 2024; Lieberman, 2023; Rakap, 2024; 
Rakap & Balikci, 2024; Seiradakis, 2024).
Bias and cultural considerations were highlighted in five studies. 
Given the diversity of neurodivergent students, it is essential to ensure 
that the content and interaction styles of Gen AI use is culturally sensitive 
and does not perpetuate stereotypes or biases (Bertacchini et al., 2023; 
Bickerstaff, 2024). For instance, Evmenova et al. (2024) found that, in 
contrast to teachers who tailor feedback based on their knowledge of 
students’ backgrounds, cultures, and languages to better align with their 
needs, Gen AI may overlook these factors, limiting its ability to provide 
effective feedback and suggestions for improvement. One study also 
noted the currently limited capacity of Gen AI for non-English languages 
(Seiradakis, 2024).
The need for enhanced AI literacy and the development of guidelines 
for responsible AI use was emphasized in half of the articles. It is 
important that both educators and students acquire AI literacy skills to 
effectively use Gen AI for learning and teaching (Evmenova et al., 2024). 
For instance, in their study exploring the use of Gen AI with gifted stu-
dents, El Naggar et al. (2024) found that Gen AI responses were often 
limited to the keywords used in prompts, which restricted the novelty 
and diversity of ideas and viewpoints generated compared to traditional 
in-class discussions.
While these concerns are foundational, much of the emphasis among 
the articles suggested that teachers should bear the responsibility of both 
their use and their students’ use of Gen AI in classrooms. Without policies 
in place, there are many dilemmas facing teachers in using Gen AI for 
their work. Yet, developing these policies that keep up with an ever 
changing and evolving climate of Gen AI development is challenging.
The following section responds to the fourth objective of this review, 
the identification of critical gaps in current knowledge to inform future 
research directions.
8. Critical gaps in current knowledge
The diverse nature of sources identified in this scoping 
review—ranging from peer-reviewed empirical studies to grey literature 
(e.g., blogs and professional commentary), reflects the nascent state of 
Gen AI applications in supporting neurodivergent students. This het-
erogeneity of evidence types is characteristic of emerging fields where 
formal research has not yet caught up with rapid technological 
M. Ronksley-Pavia et al.

developments and practitioner innovations. The predominance of non- 
peer-reviewed sources suggests that much of the current discourse 
around Gen AI and neurodiversity exists in professional practice com-
munities and not (as yet) in traditional academic research, emphasizing 
the urgency of practitioner interest and the critical need for rigorous 
empirical investigation in the field.
A critical examination of the literature from the scoping review 
revealed significant gaps between broad claims about Gen AI applica-
tions and its actual practical implementations. While personalized 
learning was frequently cited as a key benefit of Gen AI for neuro-
divergent students, many studies offered limited concrete guidance on 
actual implementation. There was little evidence of any distinction be-
tween approaches to personalized learning that could apply to all stu-
dents (i.e., regardless of neurodiversity status), from those that were 
genuinely considering students’ neurodiversity. In terms of the latter, 
the articles that examined specific neurodivergent populations appeared 
to be most helpful. Further, from a study design perspective, it would 
seem important to use various comparison groups—neurodivergent with 
Gen AI approach versus neurodivergent without Gen AI approach as a 
minimum, nevertheless it would be instructive to include non- 
neurodivergent students with and without using Gen AI. Moreover, 
there was minimal guidance on integrating Gen AI-generated personal-
ized content into existing lesson plans and curricula. This likely extends 
more broadly beyond neurodivergent students to criticisms of Gen AI 
research to date in terms of applicability in real classroom situations, 
although this was beyond the scope of the current review.
The administrative support function of Gen AI, particularly in IEP 
development, similarly lacked detailed implementation frameworks. 
Beyond Rakap’s (2023) experimental work on Chat GPT-assisted IEP 
goal development, there is a significant absence of guidance on best 
practices for using Gen AI in educational documentation, ensuring regu-
latory compliance, or establishing efficient workflows that integrate 
with existing administrative processes and systems.
Conceivably most significant is that classroom-level guidance for 
actually using Gen AI to support neurodivergent students is largely ab-
sent from the current literature. Despite frequent references to Gen AI in 
supporting classroom teaching, there was minimal discussion of prac-
tical aspects in general or more targeted to supporting neurodiversity, 
such as lesson planning examples, classroom management strategies 
when implementing Gen AI, or methods for balancing individual student 
use of Gen AI with larger group instruction. The literature provided little 
insight into how teachers might monitor, and support students’ Gen AI 
use during lessons or integrate these tools across different subject areas 
and learning activities.
Additionally, the scoping review revealed substantial gaps in 
addressing crucial implementation aspects, like professional develop-
ment needs for educators, protocols for evaluating the effectiveness of 
Gen AI interventions, and specific prompting strategies tailored to neu-
rodivergent learners requirements. There was also limited guidance on 
documenting and sharing successful implementations or involving par-
ents/caregivers and students in Gen AI-supported learning for neuro-
diversity. These gaps in the literature emphasize a crucial need for 
research on theoretical applications and practical classroom imple-
mentation for supporting the diverse needs of neurodivergent students 
in schools. Further, there is a need for future research that moves beyond 
merely describing potential applications to providing evidence-based, 
practical guidance, approaches and activities for educators working 
with neurodivergent students. Such research should focus on developing 
and evaluating specific protocols, strategies, and evidence-informed 
practices for implementing Gen AI in educational contexts for address-
ing the unique needs of neurodivergent learners.
9. Future research
Future research should develop and apply theoretical frameworks 
and use empirically designed approaches to collect evidence of the 
impact of Gen AI on educational practices, including how it may be 
leveraged to support neurodivergent learners in inclusive classrooms, 
and whether it enhances and effectively contributes to teaching and 
learning experiences and outcomes. Building on the learning strategies 
identified by Lai and Tu (2024) for Gen AI integration, such as 
problem-posing strategies, computational thinking approaches, and 
collaborative learning methods, future studies could explore how these 
can be adapted for neurodivergent learners. Additionally, further qual-
itative research is needed to capture the nuanced perceptions of both 
educators and neurodivergent students regarding the use of Gen AI in 
educationthis could provide deeper insights into its practical applica-
tions and addressing challenges.
Further work is needed to examine the application of general Gen AI- 
supported pedagogical approaches for neurodivergent students. Ap-
proaches that work well in typical, mainstream inclusive classrooms 
may not work well in addressing the specific learning requirements of 
neurodivergent students. It would be important for future research to 
concentrate more on neurodiversity to explore specific concerns that 
relate explicitly to neurodivergent populations.
10. Conclusion
The scoping review identified significant gaps in the current litera-
ture on the use of Gen AI for neurodivergent students, with a notable lack 
of empirical studies investigating its efficacy, ethical implications, and 
the qualitative perceptions of both students and teachers. Another sig-
nificant concern was that only 38 % of the articles had been peer 
reviewed, suggesting there may be a lag in timely publication of Gen AI 
research studies. While there were numerous summaries, overviews, and 
blogs discussing the potential of Gen AI in educational contexts, few 
studies had rigorously explored whether Gen AI actually facilitated 
achievement of learning goals, improved student outcomes, or contrib-
uted to effective pedagogy (e.g., personalized learning).
The concerns surrounding the use of Gen AI in educational contexts, 
particularly for neurodivergent students, underscore potential risks such 
as misinformation, over-reliance, privacy issues, and cultural bias. While 
Gen AI offers promising benefits, these challenges emphasize the need 
for careful oversight, ethical considerations, and the development of AI 
literacy that involves obtaining knowledge skills and understanding of 
critically using Gen AI safely and ethically among teachers and neuro-
divergent students in schools.
The evidence suggests that Gen AI has potential in supporting edu-
cators working with neurodivergent students by reducing administrative 
burdens, assisting with curriculum development, and providing 
personalized feedback, and instructional support. However, despite 
limited empirical evidence (to date), the need for human oversight and 
professional judgment remains crucial to ensure that Gen AI-generated 
content and recommendations are appropriately tailored to individual 
neurodivergent student requirements. As demonstrated by recent 
research that explored individual differences in Gen AI interactions (e.g., 
Tu, 2024), understanding how different learner characteristics influence 
Gen AI usage and effectiveness of this use, will be crucial for developing 
targeted approaches for supporting neurodivergent students.
