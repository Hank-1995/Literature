Digital data have an increasingly prominent role in various life sectors, ushering in an importance 
for data literacy education (DLE) in schools. To better understand the versatile educational 
purposes in this multifaceted topic for students’ well-rounded development, this paper presents 
an in-depth scrutiny into “what DLE is for” in K-12 education. We utilized Gert Biesta’s (2009) 
holistic account of “good education”, which brings together three interconnected 
domains—becoming equipped with skills (qualification), becoming a part of social orders (so-
cialization), and becoming the subject of one’s own life (subjectification)—to examine prior DLE 
research and explore how such domains of educational purpose have been portrayed in different 
ways. Our analysis shows that while there is some need for clarifying meanings of the expressed 
purposes of DLE, there are recognizable educational goals focused on cultivating data savvy 
students for present and future societal roles, most notably data-centric professions and coping in 
everyday data environments. Aims of gaining personal value from data and empowering students 
for critical engagement with data(fication) were also present to complement DLE in terms of its 
more subjectification-oriented viewpoints. Overall, intriguing meanings, synergies, and cross- 
pressures can be identified, calling for the recognition of the pluralistic approaches and culti-
vation of balance in them to holistically educate students to exist in and with the data-rich world. 
Further investigations and fundamental discussions about educational emphases in DLE research 
as well as informed engagement in them in local educational decision-making are encouraged.
1. Introduction
Data technologies are being increasingly integrated into various societal sectors, including education. While the concept of “data” 
can be interpreted in various ways,1 in data literacy it is often used to denote quantified digital material that is typically aimed at 
portraying real-world phenomena through mathematical representations (e.g., Bowler et al., 2017; Ghodoosi et al., 2023; Jarke & 
Macgilchrist, 2021; Pangrazio & Selwyn, 2023; Raffaghelli et al., 2022). It serves many practical purposes, including evaluation, 
analysis, making predictions, and guiding decision-making in various fields (Mandinach & Gummer, 2013; Pentland, 2013; Ridsdale 
et al., 2015). Although the capacity of digital data to represent social complexity has been somewhat questioned (Sefton-Green &

1 The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines data primarily as “factual information (such as measurements or statistics) used as a basis for reasoning, 
discussion, or calculation”. Inclusively considered, however, data is “what is used as data”, such as maps (e.g., Shreiner, 2019), research data (e.g., 
Webber et al., 2014), or information represented digitally as symbols and processed algorithmically.

Pangrazio, 2022), the transformation of human activities into digital data points currently exceeds basic forms of digital behavior and 
encompasses even more complex phenomena such as relationships and emotions (Pangrazio et al., 2023). The term “datafication” has 
been employed to depict processes by which several real-world matters are converted into data streams for computer-based processing 
(Couldry & Yu, 2018).
While digital data are essentially of technical nature, they also encompass a socio-technical dimension (Jarke & Macgilchrist, 2021; 
Tufekci, 2015). It is essential to consider the context in which data is collected, the intentions behind the collection, and how it is 
intended to be applied (Pangrazio & Selwyn, 2023, pp. 49–50). Notably, particular societal issues have emerged (Jansen, 2021), such 
as concerns regarding personal data rights (e.g., the right to decide what personal information is collected and shared; see e.g., GDPR 
and DSA2). There are additional questions regarding individuals being increasingly defined by data technologies (Sefton-Green & 
Pangrazio, 2022) as well as the broader societal harms caused by, for instance, the discreet monitoring of personal data (dataveillance) 
and algorithmic discrimination (Pronzato & Markham, 2023).
The changing landscape of data (Carmi et al., 2020; Jarke & Macgilchrist, 2021; Pentland, 2013; Tedre et al., 2020; Valtonen et al., 
2019) has thus led to calls for a discerning perspective in K-12 education, often characterized as data literacy education (DLE). While the 
proliferation of data has begun prompting a need for data-related competencies for contemporary job markets (Ridsdale et al., 2015) 
and various domains of problem-solving and decision-making (Mandinach & Gummer, 2013; Pentland, 2013), it has also begun 
requiring students to face data manifestations in both everyday media (Valtonen et al., 2019) and predictive analytics in schools (Jarke 
& Macgilchrist, 2021), as well as consider their autonomy in making informed decisions about personal data (Gstrein & Beaulieu, 
2022; Sander, 2023). While such viewpoints are inherently different, they are neatly generalized in Gert Biesta’s (2009; 2020) account 
of “good education”: a holistic perspective that recognizes the complexity and multifaceted nature of education and helps outlining 
discussions about its overarching goals and outcomes: what is (data literacy) education for?
When we talk about the purpose of something, we usually mean the reason why it exists; the end it serves. That being said, there is a 
lack of in-depth knowledge of the broad educational aims in data literacy, as previous literature reviews in DLE have focused on 
portraying research efforts in general (Ghodoosi et al., 2023) and specific viewpoints such as constructionist approaches (Dangol & 
Dasgupta, 2023), assessments (Cui et al., 2023), and learning with open data (Pellegrino & Antelmi, 2023). As also discussed by Jansen 
(2021), the increased significance of data literacy in responding to datafication especially underscores the importance of examining the 
forms of DLE that are made visible. Therefore, it is meaningful to examine how DLE could be viewed in relation to holistic education 
and how to strike a balance among different objectives in this context.
This review explores the domains of educational purpose that have been elucidated in prior K–12 DLE research. In practice, we 
present a scrutinization of ways in which Biesta’s three core domains of educational purpose—qualification, socialization, and sub-
jectification—have been portrayed in the research literature and how they may interconnect. The orientation of this qualitative review 
is integrative; rather than presenting prior research descriptively or statistically, the analysis is guided by focused theoretical con-
structs to observe qualitative characteristics, patterns, and relations (Kirkevold, 1997; Whittemore & Knafl, 2005). This approach 
allows aggregating and scrutinizing the pluralistic meanings that have been collectively raised in scholarly discussions to foster new 
theoretical developments and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of this multifaceted topic. The present review is steered by 
the following three-pronged research question (RQ): How have the domains of … 
RQ1. qualification,
RQ2. socialization, and
RQ3. subjectification been expressed in DLE research in the context of K-12 education?
In the theoretical background, we examine the term “data literacy” and reflect on it using Biesta’s (2009) framework. Subsequently, 
we outline the protocol followed in this review. We then present the results of our analysis and discuss our key insights and 
contributions.
2. Theoretical background
2.1. Data literacy
Our conceptual approach in data-related education is set within the relatively commonly adopted domain of “literacy” (Inverarity 
et al., 2022). Combining the perspectives of reading and writing, literacy is a multifaceted concept that has been used in various 
contexts to describe different aspects of meaning making. In an educational context, literacy can be understood as a prescriptive 
concept (Roberts, 2005) that describes not only what something is, but also what it should be. Thus, literacy helps to describe, for 
example, the learning objectives to be pursued through education.
Although theorization is still ongoing (Inverarity et al., 2022), two broad approaches to data literacy can be distinguished: one that 
is anchored in the disciplinary paradigm of data science and the methods and processes associated with statistics and informatics (see 
e.g., Shields, 2005), and a more socio-technically oriented persepctive. With respect to the former, data literacy has been defined as, for 
2 GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation; https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_en) and DSA (The 
Digital Services Act; https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package) are EU-level regulations that address issues 
regarding digital rights, data privacy, and online services.

instance, “an ability to collect, manage, evaluate, and apply data, in a critical manner” (Ridsdale et al., 2015). As such it includes 
various forms of knowing and doing related to, for instance, hypothesis generation, data interpretation, and the subsequent devel-
opment of courses of action (Mandinach & Gummer, 2013). These definitions draw on an instrumentalist view of literacy as a 
subject-object-relationship (Burnett & Merchant, 2020) in which the subject (human) learns to master the object (data).
Instead of a generic definition of literacy, however, we recognize its’ diversity. How data literacy is conceptualized or enacted can 
vary in relation to social, technological, and cultural contexts (Cook-Gumperz, 2006; Street, 2003; Scribner, 1984). Through this 
framing, focus can be centred specifically on the data-rich world, particularly on the intersection of the technical and social qualities of 
data (Jansen, 2021). Thus, according to the second broad approach, data literacy can be understood as a complex term that accounts 
for a rich nature that connects to the pervasive presence of data and its personal and societal implications driven by forces such as 
commercialization and commodification of data (Ideland et al., 2021; Pangrazio et al., 2023). Everyday examples include data-based 
tracking and profiling of individuals to optimize media content and provide instant gratification (Valtonen et al., 2019), spreading 
disinformation based on user profiles (Carmi et al., 2020), and narrating futures based on predictive analytics (Jarke & Macgilchrist, 
2021). Speaking the same story, several modern technologies rely on user-generated data without clearly informing the user, setting 
this data fundamentally apart from traditional research data (Tufekci, 2015). Such approaches have been occasionally called “critical 
data literacy” (e.g., Markham, 2020; Sander, 2023)—not a judgmental or negativistic attitude, but a reflective and a questioning 
approach (see also Inverarity et al., 2022; Jansen, 2021)—which also pertains to media literacy and multiliteracy. However, we argue 
that the purpose of data literacy is not to replace other literacies but to build upon them, articulating a unique approach that accounts 
for both skill-centric and more reflective and self-determination-oriented aspects specifically in data-intensive contexts (see also Tedre 
et al., 2020; Vartiainen et al., 2024).
2.2. Domains of educational purpose
The core “pillars” of teaching and learning can be viewed in different ways, such as Bloom et al., 1956 taxonomy or through various 
educational standards. However, our theoretical basis for examining DLE is Biesta’s (2009) account of “good education”, which has 
prompted holistically viewing and discussing its different yet not disconnected purposes, goals, and outcomes as well as reflecting on 
their balance (see also Franch, 2020; Lomsdal et al., 2023). The framework is selected for its adherence to a broader question of 
educational purpose: why data literacy is taught and learnt. It is also selected for its well-rounded nature and commitment to theo-
retically grounded underpinnings that aim for individual flourishing and self-formation that encompass both skill-based ends as well as 
such matters as reflection and agency development, as also associated with the more inclusive notions on literacy (Cook-Gumperz, 
2006; Street, 2003; Scribner, 1984), while being sensitive to contextual factors (e.g., educational systems may determine what is 
ultimately emphasized). The framework depicts three fundamental domains in which education may impact (positively or negatively): 
qualification, socialization, and subjectification.
Qualification focuses on equipping individuals with the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that, as Biesta (2009, 2015) framed it, 
“qualifies” them to “do something”. Generally in education, emphasis has increasingly been on obtaining qualifications that lead to 
economic success in the job market, as has also been expressed in the context of data literacy (Ridsdale et al., 2015). Qualification does 
not, however, merely involve promoting specific professional or vocational skills or techniques, but also general tasks and re-
sponsibilities, ranging from broader life skills to, for instance, cultural awareness. For data literacy, this could involve learning to 
critically think about data (Ridsdale et al., 2015), understanding contextual significances in data (Pangrazio & Selwyn, 2023), and 
generally make data-driven decisions in different aspects of life (Mandinach & Gummer, 2013; Pentland, 2013). This domain is 
therefore important for both personal development and economic reasons, as it helps individuals contribute to workforce and to the 
society (Biesta, 2009).
Socialization in education refers to the process by which individuals “become part” of something, whether these are, for instance, 
social, cultural, or political groups or orders (Biesta, 2009). It can involve the transmission of both norms and values regarding societal 
traditions and professional standards alike. The potential relevance of DLE to adapt to and participate in data-rich contexts, such as the 
presence of data technologies in everyday life (Valtonen et al., 2019) and to meet “what is required” to, for instance, join the workforce 
(Inverarity et al., 2022) are rather straightforward notions (and demonstrations of the expected links between the domains; namely, 
socialization and qualification). Moreover, although socialization can be intentional, education always has a more or less covert so-
cializing effect, influencing how individuals fit into existing structures in terms of the positive and negative aspects of these structures 
alike. A caricature of this concept is behavioral engineering, that is, an outright shaping of students in how they perceive themselves 
and their relationships with others (Eynon, 2022).
Subjectification is as an ignition in students to embrace their own courses of action as autonomous individuals (Biesta, 2009). It 
pertains to the question of “how one exists” here and now, promoting the enactment of one’s own choices. In practice, subjectification 
can be framed as ways to empower students about how they exist not as the object of what others want from them but by placing 
matters within their control and granting them the freedom to make their own decisions without imposing external labels or judgments 
on their behavior; responding in self-determined ways to situations (Biesta, 2020). Similar ideas regarding the reflection of the effects 
of data technologies have been involved in critical data literacy (e.g., Sander, 2023; Tygel & Kirsch, 2016) and the more agency-centric 
approaches in data literacy (Tedre et al., 2020; Vartiainen et al., 2024). Demonstrating further links amongst the domains, such 
reflection can be theorized to benefit from, for instance, an understanding of algorithmic systems (i.e., qualification; see e.g., Pangrazio 
& Selwyn, 2023; Vartiainen et al., 2024).
As illustrated above, the three domains are unique but also interconnected, and the effectiveness of education lies in how they 
intersect (Biesta, 2009); a point that invites interrogating their meanings and interrelationships. Conflicts between the domains are 
J. Fagerlund et al.

also possible, offering a stimulating point to contemplate such relationships more broadly. For example, somewhat paradoxically for 
holistic education, subjectification is the opposite of socialization, as it encourages non-conformity and independence from existing 
social orders (Biesta, 2009). Adapting to data-rich contexts by providing personal data to platforms while simultaneously protecting 
personal privacy by exercising the right to decide what personal data is collected and used (Gstrein & Beaulieu, 2022) provides one 
example; a tension between integrating into digital platforms and preserving data autonomy. Biesta (2015, 2020) however posits that 
subjectification may be regarded as the primary domain, as, for instance, knowledge (qualification) is essentially a subjective phe-
nomenon. He nonetheless clarifies that subjectification essentially involves learning to collide one’s own thoughts, opinions, and 
beliefs with the world through a kind of reality check; not simply doing as one pleases but a freedom that establishes on existence in the 
real-world that responds to one’s actions. In data-based contexts, this could mean, for instance, a balance of assimilation and autonomy 
as well as adopting ethical dispositions in data-rich contexts (Loftus & Madden, 2020). Resultantly, subjectification is about recog-
nizing limits: how our actions may face resistance or create problems as well as discerning which limits are genuine and which, for 
instance, discriminatory.
3. Literature review
3.1. Search procedure
Following the steps for conducting an (integrative) literature review (Par´e & Kitsiou, 2017; Whittemore & Knafl, 2005), we began 
our work by outlining a focus: students’ data literacy in K-12 education. We limited the scope to K-12 to concentrate solely on 
general education, which is mandatory for everyone.
To gain a nascent understanding of the conceptual landscape within the field, we conducted an initial scoping of the literature. 
Although there was terminological diversity, the term “data literacy” was rather prominent and thus appropriate for use regardless that 
there are interrelated discussions around terms such as “data science” and “AI literacy”.3 A similar decision to avoid exceeding the 
focus has also been made previously (e.g., Cui et al., 2023; Ghodoosi et al., 2023). The search process began with the identification of 
information sources, followed by an assessment of their quality to form the final corpus to be analyzed (Par´e & Kitsiou, 2017; see 
Table 1 and Fig. 1 for details about the procedure). The final corpus is presented in Appendix A.
3.2. Analysis of studies
The analysis was conducted in four phases, as shown in Table 3. A combination of deductive and inductive analytical logic (see also 
Reichertz, 2013) were utilized to examine what aspects of the educational goal domains had been expressed in the literature. Namely, 
in phase 2, manifestations of the theoretical constructs (i.e., the three domains of educational purpose; see subsection 2.2) were 
searched for in the gathered groundings of data literacy using deductive qualitative content analysis, that is, an identification of 
meanings based on pre-set criteria (Schreier, 2013, pp. 14–15). In phases 3 and 4, the resulting meanings were evaluated inductively as 
to how they presented recurring themes within and across the domains (Reichertz, 2013, pp. 9–10).
4. Results
The themes produced by the analysis (see Fig. 2) were intriguing both in themselves as well as with regard to their position within 
the triad. However, we found that a higher conceptual level was necessary to make better sense of their unique as well as relational 
meanings. Therefore, to (re)position and connect the themes to each other, we further discerned four not unrelated thematic macro 
strands (see Fig. 3): coping in data-intensive contexts, data-related training and studying, finding personal value in data, and critical 
engagement with data(fication). For instance, while data competencies (qualification) were occasionally depicted as an end in 
themselves, they could also be prerequisites or components of professional qualifications (qualification and socialization); assimilating 
to the skill requirements in different vocations and careers. This reflects the broader idea of “data-related training and studying”, which 
also involves the aim of enhancing learning and studying with data (qualification) that, in turn, may also involve an empowerment of 
subjectivity (qualification and subjectification). Moreover, both aims can ultimately address instrumental needs, such as satisfying 
educational policy standards (socialization), which can also be an end in itself. In the following sections, we present the meanings of 
each theme and their interrelationships through the four macro strands (in subsections 4.1 to 4.4), accompanied by sample highlights 
from the source literature (see matching reference codes for the studies in Appendix A).
4.1. Coping in data-intensive contexts
This strand concerns the broad idea of meeting specified skill requirements essentially to be able to cope in data-intensive contexts. 
This can include two general purposes, the acquisition of a range of competencies needed in everyday life (qualification and social-
ization; 4.1.1) and as an adaptation to specific kinds of data contexts (socialization; 4.1.2), both of which are affiliated, but where the 
3 AI can be understood as an umbrella term encompassing technologies that are linked to large-scale data collection and machine learning. In 
other words, data can be understood as the “raw material” for AI-based systems. Consequently, AI literacy may have a broader substance focus than 
data literacy, although they may share some overarching educational objectives (see e.g., Kahila et al., 2024).
J. Fagerlund et al.

latter is of somewhat higher specificity and more distinctly about assimilation rather than competence acquisition.
4.1.1. Everyday competencies
The premise in everyday competencies in DLE is becoming generally prepared for the world where data is increasingly prevalent 
(ST70), even in “almost all aspects (or sectors) of life”, as mentioned by several studies (ST18; ST25; ST64). With respect to the more 
qualification-based aims, data literacy is expressed as an important “civic skill” (ST63) and as important for general knowledge or 
reasoning for everyday life (ST26; ST47; ST75). It is expressed to be needed across a range of “scientific, political, and industrial 
applications” (ST54), for “everyday processes across sectors and fields” (ST2), in preparing for life beyond the classroom (ST69), and 
even in “all roles” of the society (ST41). In the most general terms, the self-promoting emphasis on the centrality of becoming trained as 
“data (literate) citizens” (ST43; ST50) are expressed.
Pertaining especially to the socialization aspect of such competencies, data literacy is expressed to be “necessary” for the population 
(ST32; ST59) due to its role in navigating the data-rich world (ST25), adapting to changing knowledge requirements (ST37), and 
following “the development of the era” (ST71); that is, enabling individuals to integrate into a data-centric society, adapt to its re-
quirements, and follow its developmental trajectories. That being said, slightly more specific arguments expressed the relevance of 
everyday competencies through the importance of becoming an informed member in civic life (ST39; ST68; ST70). Although such 
statements can have various interpretations, they can be understood as becoming socialized to become wise (i.e., qualified) democratic 
patrons in, for instance, policymaking and voting (ST31), and in the use of data tools to participate in the society (ST26).
Altogether, such competencies were expressed at a rather general level, and hence they may be viewed as abstractions of any and all 
more specific data(fication)-related competencies (see subsections 4.2.1 and 4.4.1). Nevertheless, this theme was maintained for its 
distinct presence as a rhetorical device.
4.1.2. Adapting to data contexts
The previous theme can be paralleled to an affiliate kind of adaptation, which can be separated from the previous for its higher 
contextual specificity and the lesser (but not necessarily missing) role of qualifications, thus emphasizing the significance of assimi-
lation into data-intensive contexts (socialization). In particular, the core idea is to take datafication as a given state of the world, rather

Description of the stages of the literature search process.
Stage
Description
1. Identification of information 
sources
Multiple databases were used to ensure a comprehensive search. We searched for the most relevant term “data literacy” as a 
keyword. Simultaneously, we used the search term “education* OR pedagog* OR teach* OR instruct* OR learn* OR student* 
OR school*” (i.e., any word was accepted, while the asterisk served as a wildcard to accept different syntactic forms). These 
terms were searched for in abstracts when possible as we observed that some studies did not include such terms in their 
keywords or titles.
2. Cleaning
To prepare the initial corpus for screening, we initially cleaned it using Zotero referencing software. Duplicate records, 
retracted articles, and articles written in languages other than English were removed.
3. Cursory screening
Two screening stages were employed to assess the quality of the acquired material through a systematic application of inclusion 
and exclusion criteria (Par´e & Kitsiou, 2017; see Table 2 for details). During this stage, the titles, keywords, and publication 
types were screened.
4. Content screening
The abstracts and, where necessary for verification, the full texts of the remaining studies were screened.
5. An additional “snowball” 
search
A final “snowball” search was conducted by revisiting previous relevant literature reviews (Cui et al., 2023; Ghodoosi et al., 
2023) to verify that potentially relevant papers were not overlooked.

a The search was limited to peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers, as they are typically well-curated, accessible, structurally 
consistent, and contain mainly original research. Moreover, research in digital education specifically is often published in conference proceedings (e. 
g., ACM). The additional value of including book chapters was not deemed to be significant.

than to question it. Students are taught to cope by becoming users of data-based technologies and media: when using daily devices 
(ST25), gaining access to information and entertainment (ST34), coming to terms with personal digital traces (ST46), and providing 
and facilitating understanding of everyday data and (data-driven) claims (ST65; ST69; ST75). Data visualizations are a notable 
example (ST38; ST73), and critical engagement with them is even expressed to be a civic responsibility (ST57).
This theme can also include teaching students to use media responsibly and reasonably (ST34); a form of socially normative 
behavior. Similarly, the advocation of mindsets such as a promotion of democratic core values (ST27), empathy (ST70), and ethics and 
social justice (ST40) through data literacy are expressed. In turn, data literacy is expressed as being important for becoming an “action- 
oriented citizen” (ST40), which involves assimilation into active communal behavior, that is, a form of role fulfillment and collective 
contribution based on societal expectations.
4.2. Data-related training and studying
Data-related training and studying represents a major strand that has roots in the prominent theme of data competencies (quali-
fication; 4.2.1), which were deemed as an objective in themselves and as a precursor to ulterior purposes. Namely, they can be also 
intended for three somewhat distinct themes: meeting professional qualification requirements (qualification and socialization; 4.2.2), 
enhancing learning and studying in the school context (qualification; 4.2.3), and socializing into data opportunities that students can 
harness for subjective growth (socialization and subjectification; described in the context of the following strand, i.e., in subsection 
4.3). Furthermore, learning and studying about data can be about or involve the promotion of subjectivity (qualification and sub-
jectification; 4.2.4), and it can also be intended for instrumental purposes (socialization; 4.2.5).
4.2.1. Data competencies
Data competencies (qualification) includes aspects akin to data science skills, problem-solving skills and tool mastery, and sta-
tistical and research skills, which are arguably highly analogous in practice but can also be conceptualized in different ways. Data 
science skills incorporate the generic idea of being able to recognize and work with data (ST64). A wide range of capacity aims is 
Table 3 
An overview of the analysis process.
Analysis phase
Process description
Notes
1. Collection of 
quotations from the 
literature
The studies in the corpus were read and expressed groundings of 
data literacy, that is, argumentation and justification of its 
educational goals, intents, and/or purposes were gathered (total: 
611 expressions in the 77 studies). Bottom-up labelling was also 
conducted regarding recurrences in educational settings, 
conceptual foci, data literacy aspects, and rhetorical points in 
each article. Author 1 carried out the first two phases of the 
analysis.
Only the early (i.e., Introduction or Background) and final (i.e., 
Discussion or Conclusions) sections of the articles were examined, 
as they primarily focused on the broad or overarching educational 
meanings of data literacy on a shared level of conceptual 
abstraction. Papers that did not adhere to the established IMRa D 
(Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) structure were 
examined more thoroughly. Only sufficiently clear arguments 
regarding educational purposes were accepted, as otherwise there 
would have been too much ambiguity in the analysis. All 
arguments were collected, regardless of whether or not the article 
clearly expressed a conceptual or thematic position with them.
2. Application of 
thematic criteria
Pertinences to qualification, socialization, and subjectification as 
well as their intersecting areas were identified in the expressions 
through content analysis (Schreier, 2013, pp. 14–15) utilizing 
descriptions in the theoretical framework (see subsection 2.2), 
resulting in an initial number of 847 interpretations across the 
domains. Potential themes in the interpretations were 
simultaneously identified through bottom-up labelling (
Reichertz, 2013, pp. 9–10) based on similarities and differences 
in the expressions.
The purpose statements were interpreted in relation to the three 
domains both in isolation and as part of the articles’ narrative 
macro-structures (i.e., higher-level conceptual reasoning, 
argumentation, and semantic connections, e.g. relationships or 
hierarchies of the key concepts, aims, or overarching objectives).
3. Peer reconciliation
The three authors engaged in a peer reconciliation process to 
confirm the interpretation of the expressions next to the three 
domains and discuss the potential themes. This process involved 
open consensus building and agreement, with each expression 
being evaluated and negotiated. 15% of the interpretations (131 
out of 847) were modified in the reconciliation process, 
ultimately resulting in 470 expressions pertaining to 
qualification (expressed in 100% of the studies), 180 pertaining 
to socialization (in 82%), and 171 pertaining to subjectification 
(in 71%).
The purpose of this step was to strengthen the integrity of the 
analysis due to the potentially different viewpoints (Cornish et al., 
2013). A blind coding procedure was not feasible because the 
theory does not provide clear themes that can be used with 
minimal interpretation when operationalizing it in a new domain, 
which is also argued by Biesta (2009). The varying nature, level, 
and articulation of expressions in the source material also justifies 
the use of a consensus-building approach.
4. Validation of 
recurring themes
Author 1 finalized the set of the inductively drawn themes. Each 
theme was then validated within and across the data. In case of 
mismatch, reconfiguration continued. This process was repeated 
iteratively, resulting in the gradual consolidation and abstraction 
of themes into which all expressions were eventually integrated. 
Authors 2 and 3 evaluated the final thematization and, after final 
reconfigurations, agreed that no further modifications were 
necessary.
The analysis produced distinct themes within and across the 
domains (see Fig. 2; e.g., “Data competencies” under 
qualification, “Competencies about social and political 
dimensions of data(fication)” at the intersect area of qualification 
and subjectification).
J. Fagerlund et al.

presented, including computational data literacy (ST54), knowledge management (ST14), data-related communication capabilities 
(ST67), as well as skills to work with different types of data, such as open data (ST53), big data (ST74), and data visualizations (ST33; 
ST54; ST57; ST60; ST73). Varying competence levels are also portrayed, beginning with an aspiration to raise awareness of the ex-
istence of data (ST17; ST36) and an understanding of data contexts and data collection (ST24; ST58). Higher competence levels include 
becoming familiar with data practices (ST10; ST66) and being able to, for example, evaluate the representations and quality of data 
(ST12; ST24; ST30; ST56; ST76) and create data representations (ST62).
Problem-solving, in turn, is commonly a used term with connection to a variety of cognitive and practical processes (e.g., ST6; 
ST11; ST28; ST38; ST48; ST63; ST75) with application domains in different subjects or disciplines, such as in physics (ST62) and 
mathematics (ST43). A related idea is the effective use of technological and mathematical tools (ST8; ST28; ST63), such as databases, 
spreadsheets, modeling programs, or everyday devices, as well as the development of general digital skills (ST9). A related aspect 
concerns qualifying students in statistical and research skills, that is, in adopting the habits of mind of scientists and acquiring 
readiness to conduct scientific research in general (ST12; ST55; ST72). This is specified in the promotion of expertise in, for example, 
conducting statistical analyses and making statistically sound decisions (e.g., ST16; ST38), specialist competencies in scientific 
research (e.g., ST66; ST69), and specific forms of inquiry skills (ST11; ST26; ST35; ST54; ST55; ST67; ST69; ST76). Furthermore, 
various associated cognitive goals depicting a more specific form of everyday knowledge are articulated, including aspirations for 
developing fact- or evidence-based thinking generally (ST62; ST63) and processes such as drawing conclusions (ST33), generating new 
knowledge (ST43), making decisions appropriately (ST47), and making sense of complex real-life phenomena, trends, or the world 
generally (ST10; ST20; ST32; ST38; ST67; ST68; ST71).
4.2.2. Professional qualifications
A more contextual theme and a potentially broader successive purpose for attaining a range of data competencies is the acquisition 
of professional qualifications specifically, that is, DLE as an assimilation into the skill requirements in vocations and careers (quali-
fication and socialization). Here data literacy is explicated as being used by disciplinary experts in STEM careers or similar fields (ST32; 
ST51), across fields and disciplines (ST18; ST49; ST66), and future workers in general (ST29; ST47). Data literacy is even explicated to 
be a standard skill requirement to be adapted in STEM careers or related fields (ST52; ST54), in the activities and practices in several 
specialist fields (ST10; ST32), or in virtually all jobs (ST8; ST76). Qualifications are seen relevant to avoid problems caused by data 
illiteracy in the workplace (ST58), to develop one’s knowledge and potential (ST59), persistence (ST28), task commitment (ST18), and 
to ensure success (ST9; ST50). The importance of data literacy in facing global competition (ST49; ST50; ST64) and meeting the 
challenges of the fourth industrial revolution (ST2; ST35; ST47) can also be contextualized here.
A distinctly cultural form of socialization in the context of this theme concerns the adoption of data-related mindsets. ST66 arti-
culated a soft form of this by explicating DLE as a means for acquiring education in a “highly valued” field. Similarly, helping students 
become effective employees (ST8) and fostering entrepreneurial skills (ST9) also involve an adoption of workforce-centric mindsets. 
Fig. 3. Macro strands of the purposes of DLE as discerned from the themes and their relationships 
Note. Some themes may have additional relevance to others in intricate ways. For instance, reaching personal goals and aspirations (4.3.2) may 
involve acquiring professional qualifications (4.2.2), while subjectivity in data-centric learning and making (4.2.4) may empower data agency 
(4.4.2). For simplicity, all relationships are not theorized systematically due to their potentially immense amount and nature.
J. Fagerlund et al.

Other forms include developing appreciation of data as evidence (ST48) and exciting students about data and mathematics (ST8), 
which could, however, also be affiliated with the following theme.
4.2.3. Enhancing learning and studying
The strand of data-related training and studying also includes a combinatory set of two themes (4.2.3 and 4.2.4), which concern 
promoting students’ readiness to apply data competencies specifically in the school context. The core idea in the first theme, enhancing 
learning and studying (qualification), is connecting data to schoolwork and allowing for a better understanding of real-world issues, as 
expressed in multiple studies (ST6; ST10; ST17; ST38; ST30; ST53; ST56; ST57; ST65; ST67). A similar aim concerns utilizing data in 
learning to enhance the acquisition of set learning objectives specifically (ST28) or to acquire complex information efficiently alto-
gether (ST59). A broader representation of the same idea is cross-disciplinary learning (e.g., ST52; ST69; ST70). Yet another viewpoint 
in this aspect concerns attaining competencies needed for subsequent educational levels, such as higher education (ST2; ST17; ST18; 
ST70), which, in another sense, also denotes an adaptation to data contexts (see subsection 4.1.2).
4.2.4. Subjectivity in data-centric learning and making
The promotion of subjectivity in data-centric learning and making can be understood to potentially co-occur with the previous 
theme as a distinct purpose. The aim is to promote subjectification by enacting personally meaningful learning (ST46), which involves 
harnessing personally relevant and interesting ways to engage in DLE for motivation and authenticity in learning experiences (ST13; 
ST21; ST54; ST72). Specific ideas include being inspired by a personal desire to understand phenomena (ST55), developing curiosity 
(ST77), being empowered to personally produce data (ST3), and promoting effectiveness in communicating personally valued issues 
(ST65). A similar set of ideas is in the form of maker pedagogy: the promotion of bottom-up innovation (ST76) and the creation of 
artifacts and technologies by students themselves (ST34). Although such pedagogies can be guided by instrumental intentions (so-
cialization; see the following theme), they can also concern emancipation, for example, by means of bringing out voices and personal 
stories from a precariat to rewrite dominant narratives and avoid reproducing societal hierarchies (ST46; ST61).
4.2.5. Instrumental data literacy learning
Instrumental data literacy learning is about leveraging students’ learning for external needs or interests (socialization), which can 
be a distinct purpose, but which could also be viewed as an immediate or indirect consequence of other themes. Namely, adaptation to 
data contexts (4.1.2) can produce social utility, acquiring professional qualifications (4.2.2) can generate human capital, and 
leveraging data to enhance learning and studying (4.2.3) can meet educational policy standards.
With regard to the first aspect, the production of social utility, some of the more abstract notions expressed the aims of addressing 
community needs (ST40), leading a “productive life” in the community (ST16), and addressing local issues (ST74). More specific 
statements expressed the aim of creating locally or societally valuable intellectual output (ST18), benefits (ST13), products, processes, 
or systems (ST48), and innovative solutions (ST74), as well as preparing students to crowdsource improvements to organizational data 
(ST13). Tackling “societal challenges” (ST36) was also mentioned; a concrete example is employing DLE to support the resolution of 
collective issues such as COVID-19 (ST9; ST71). ST36 presented an ambitious objective of harnessing DLE to “transform a world full of 
data into a data-driven society”.
Increasing human capital, in turn, includes an explicit aim of enhancing economic growth and creation of services (ST4), 
expectedly through the development of students’ productive skills (ST28), that is, as a potential consequence of DLE having promoted 
students’ (professional) qualifications. A related idea is preparing for designing and driving innovation with various forms of data 
(ST4; ST50; ST74). Similarly, there is a call to produce more capable data scientists (ST75) and increase the number of STEM graduates 
(ST9), which, while referring to professional qualifications, explicitly denote a labour-market driven demand. A similar group of ideas 
concerns the democratization of STEM and data science fields by engaging a wider variety of students in them (ST8; ST10; ST52).
The third aspect, albeit somewhat uncommon, is the purpose of meeting policy standards as a satisfaction of data literacy having 
been learnt in schools. This included a justification for DLE as the fulfillment of educational policies or regulations, whether they were 
transnational (e.g., by the EU; ST9), national (e.g., NGSS guidelines; ST20), or local (ST37).
4.3. Finding personal value in data
Finding personal value in data represents a relatively minor strand that can also stem from the acquisition of data competencies (see 
subsection 4.2.1). It entails gaining access to data (socialization and subjectification; 4.3.1) and, potentially, the consequent intention 
to reach personal goals and aspirations with data (subjectification; 4.3.2).
4.3.1. Gaining access to data
Gaining access to data is essentially about “opening doors” for students, be it to STEM work or studies (ST8; ST52), to common data 
tools and methods (ST51), to the opportunities offered by data (ST32), or to any meaningful participation at all (ST29). In other words, 
the central idea is to acclimatize students to existing data-centric tools, methods, and practices (socialization). While data compe-
tencies (see subsection 4.2.1) can be central contributors to such access, the primary goal is to leverage them specifically for 
empowering students to make their own decisions (subjectification) after having not missed out on personally meaningful data op-
portunities (and thus become “powerless”; ST26). While this theme involves both socialization (acclimatization) and subjectification 
(empowerment), it demonstrates how they may in fact complement rather than conflict each other.
J. Fagerlund et al.

Educational Research Review 46 (2025) 100663

4.3.2. Reaching personal goals and aspirations
A potential more elaborate purpose and a follow-up of the previous theme concerns reaching personal goals and aspirations 
(subjectification), as expressed by ways of, for instance, getting “value out of data” (e.g., ST4; ST76). This aim generally concerns 
aiding students in making data useful for themselves (ST13), involving, for instance, learning to better understand phenomena that 
relate to one’s own life (ST38; ST50) or guide one’s life with the help of data occurrences in public media (ST68), open data (ST13), or 
personally collected data (ST21; ST39). Specific aims such as experiencing satisfaction and intellectual fulfillment (ST18) and leading a 
fulfilling life (ST16) can also be contextualized here, displaying how this theme could intricately further promote qualification, for 
instance.
4.4. Critical engagement with data(fication)
Critical engagement with data(fication) is a major strand that can have roots in competencies about social and political dimensions 
of data(fication) (qualification and subjectification; 4.4.1), which can be deemed as an objective in themselves or as a precursor to 
other purposes. Namely, they may precede exercising data agency (subjectification; 4.4.2), enrich self-actualization (subjectification; 
4.4.3), and empower reformation (subjectification and socialization; 4.4.4).
4.4.1. Competencies about social and political dimensions of data(fication)
A focus in DLE can be more on learning to understand the social and political dimensions of data(fication) (qualification) and 
less—although not necessarily excluding—the instrumental qualities of data (cf. subsection 4.2.1). Central ideas are promoting a 
general awareness of the purposes of data (ST40), including the societal and political aspects of datafied technologies (ST5; ST34; 
ST42), and becoming aware of key issues about data, such as its problems (ST44; ST45; ST54), and concepts such as data privacy, data 
ownership, and data protection (ST5; ST15; ST24). Specific ideas can concern, for instance, power manifestations in data (ST7), data 
manipulations and deception (ST59), data-driven targeting practices (ST19), and data-related social disparities (ST77).
However, a further aspect is fostering specifically reflection of such matters, that is, exceeding mere awareness or conceptual 
understanding and instead aiming for turning a critical or questioning eye on data(fication). Such reflection can involve expanding 
students’ critical and reflective attitudes towards data (ST23; ST76) and evaluation of their own responses to such data representations 
as graphics (ST65). It can also involve reflection of the social and political dynamics shaping the data economy (ST1; ST42), the 
situated and ideological dimensions of data (ST61), non-neutrality in data (ST41), privacy concerns (ST45), and values embedded in 
data analyses (ST27; ST41).
Furthermore, reflection of data(fication) may also specifically concern oneself within data-intensive contexts (subjectification): the 
aim of developing enriched knowledge of specifically one’s own being amidst data-related social and political forces as well as a 
questioning of the role of data technologies in one’s own life (ST7; ST34; ST39; ST27; ST61). The core idea is to understand “how one is 
affected by, subject to and shepherds of data” (ST22), involving a heightened awareness of personal relationship and participation with 
data-based platforms (ST21; ST23), the intentional and incidental data generation (ST45), and the presence of persuasion in such 
settings (ST58). This aspect may even include the promotion of suspicion of such matters as recommendation systems (ST23) and 
moral indignation (ST39).
4.4.2. Exercising data agency
Although the idea of promoting data agency in general (e.g., ST54) can have various interpretations, it can be understood as a 
readiness to act as a subject in one’s own data contexts; a rather straightforward manifestation of subjectification in DLE. Although 
such agency can be exercised through, for instance, data-related training and studying (see subsection 4.2), the strand of critical 
engagement with data(fication) emphasizes its establishment on the central interests of safety, well-being, and civil liberties (ST45; 
ST50). It thus can pertain to achieving independence from external forces and influences, thereby retaining autonomy and control (i.e., 
independent decision-making) in data-intensive environments (ST22).
While agency may not be a question of data or datafication-related competencies in itself, it is indicated to potentially benefit from 
them. In particular, it can involve the goal of becoming qualified to critically navigate data environments (ST24; ST25) by being 
prepared against harm and unethical data practices, such as misleading and deceptive tactics (ST59; ST77) and manipulation and 
persuasion techniques (ST34; ST56; ST58). Furthermore, this aspect involves taking ownership of personal data to empower exercising 
one’s data rights (ST1), which may stem from understanding data(fication), such as learning to manage personal data following an 
awareness of its collection and its traces (ST3; ST24; ST15; ST44). The fundamental intention can be to mitigate privacy risks that can 
affect one’s own life (ST15; ST22; ST39; ST61).
4.4.3. Self-actualization in data environments
A more robust representation of agency in DLE concerns self-actualization in data environments (subjectification), that is, the 
enactment of one’s own choices, which may require empowerment for somewhat more comprehensive self-determination and self- 
realization (ST29). It is thus such introspection that invites students not merely learn to, for instance, critically navigate data envi-
ronments, but more strongly engage with their own identity and values. The foundation for such empowerment is being confronted 
with choices, which, in DLE, can involve deciding whether to accept or resist being datafied in the first place (ST44) or how to 
participate with platforms with personal data (ST22), regardless of understanding data(fication) or not.
However, qualifications may also enrich self-actualization by promoting specifically informed choices: whether or not to use or 
accept data-driven content (ST34), how to address personal data-related concerns (ST45; ST67), and determine one’s level of trust 
J. Fagerlund et al.

Educational Research Review 46 (2025) 100663

about data and acceptance of “dataveillance” (i.e., data-based monitoring) on a systemic level (ST42). Such self-determination should 
also include recognizing limitations on one’s data-related actions, which can manifest in DLE by promoting a sense of social justice 
(ST77) and making ethical judgments (ST19; ST55). In other words, since each person contributes to constructing reality, capability to 
make reasoned and responsible decisions that take into account both the common good, such as human rights, and individual interests 
(ST34; ST40; ST59) are central.
4.4.4. Reformation
A potential ulterior purpose stemming from any type of data agency, possibly including its exercise via practical-instrumental 
capabilities (see subsection 4.2), is reformation: being agentic (subjectification) within the collective reality (socialization), which 
essentially concerns preparing to contribute to shaping the digital world as empowered subjects (ST34). The core idea is informed self- 
determined (as opposed to expected) participation in shared decision-making (ST31) and, generally, advocating for change (ST39; 
ST40; ST54). Such interests mainly concern confronting practices that are, for example, discriminatory (ST22), with an overarching 
goal of collective deliberation, decision-making, and construction of emancipatory technologies and practices and transformation of 
social crises (ST5; ST27; ST45; ST77).
Two not mutually exclusive aspects of reformation can be roughly distinguished and elaborated further: individual and systemic. 
Individual reformation means change by individuals within a system. It can include the goal of personally engaging with the com-
plications of data use and challenging the status quo (ST7) and developing issues for social justice and data activism (ST50). Concrete 
examples include challenging data artifacts that can racialize and reproduce societal hierarchies (ST46), as well as addressing in-
equalities and challenging beliefs about students themselves and their local communities by rewriting dominant narratives from 
personal perspectives (ST61). Systemic reformation, in turn, means transformations of broad issues, such as policies, laws, regulations, 
and institutional practices. From a policy perspective, it can involve engagement with the politics of data, such as racial-ideological 
issues (ST46), advancing public policy (ST17), promoting government transparency and accountability (ST21), and upholding de-
mocracy and democratic processes in general (ST44). It can also aim at challenging established systems and practices, such as 
redistribution of power (ST56), for example by disrupting data processing in general as well as by resisting data-centric epistemologies 
and ontologies (ST44) and challenging dominant ideologies or beliefs (ST42).
5. Discussion
5.1. Summary of findings
The results demonstrated that DLE encompasses a multitude of intricate thematic purposes, which can be connected to existing data 
literacy literature in numerous ways. Notably, qualification was represented by fostering students’ diverse competencies related to 
data(fication) both in themselves and for contextual application at both personal and socially rooted levels (see also Mandinach & 
Gummer, 2013; Pangrazio & Selwyn, 2023; Pentland, 2013; Ridsdale et al., 2015). Socialization primarily included instrumental 
objectives (Ghodoosi et al., 2023) and aims of assimilating students into the data-rich society, such as the data workforce (see also 
Inverarity et al., 2022), as well as acclimatize them to leverage the possibilities of data (Pellegrino & Antelmi, 2023). Subjectification 
included fostering personal ambitions (Loftus & Madden, 2020) as well as different forms of data agency (Dangol & Dasgupta, 2023; 
Gstrein & Beaulieu, 2022; Sander, 2023; Tedre et al., 2020; Tygel & Kirsch, 2016).
An intriguing observation was that although the discerned themes amongst the three domains of educational purpose (see Fig. 2) 
were rather disparate, there were considerable interconnections and relationships between them, particularly when viewed through 
the macro strands (see Fig. 3). For instance, data(fication)-related competencies may contribute to gaining access to opportunities and 
value in data (Pellegrino & Antelmi, 2023), while data agency may benefit from an enriched understanding of data(fication) 
(Pangrazio & Selwyn, 2023; Vartiainen et al., 2024). As a rough example, one form of DLE could be rooted in data(fication) 
competence acquisition and transcend via an empowerment of data agency to social reformation. Generally considered, each theme 
and strand, including the several straightforward as well as intricate links amongst them, appears educationally meaningful and 
attentive to well-rounded education in its own way, which would immediately introduce balance to DLE.
While there were no evident tensions between the strands, some can be identified between the themes (e.g., between skills and 
agency and between conformity and autonomy). While no general guideline can be provided on which are inherently preferable over 
the others, imbalance with respect to well-rounded education may emerge if one is given much greater priority over the other. To this 
end, we further discuss the findings through three meta-level vignettes that, firstly, reflect on contemporary educational discourse 
leaning towards qualification (Biesta, 2009; in subsection 5.1.1). Secondly, we call for clarity in DLE’s purposes, as motivated by 
having identified some ambivalent rhetoric in the literature (5.1.2). Altogether, we advocate for balance and intermediation in DLE, 
while noting Biesta’s (2020) emphasis that subjectification could be at the centre of (or around) everything. This would prioritize 
strands where it appears strongest, however, unlikely without issues. Thus, thirdly, we contemplate the role of data agency within 
holistic education before proceeding to outline the implications of the study.
5.1.1. Accelerated training of future data professionals?
While the overall portrayal of DLE as presented by this study is comprehensive, a key question is how isolated themes or strands 
may be emphasized in education. Although this review did not aim to discern priorities, the previously observed prominent function of 
qualification in contemporary education (Biesta, 2009) was hinted at through the high number of goal expressions situated within this 
domain (see Table 3) and qualification having had a fundamental relevance across the findings. Although qualifications encompassed

viewpoints related to the somewhat more recent “critical data literacy” perspective (e.g., Markham, 2020), the emphasis on preparing 
technically data-savvy students for various societal roles was especially predictable, given the historically longer and perhaps more 
established overlap between data literacy and data science (Shields, 2005). Skill- and work-oriented aspects have also been identified 
as being prominent in data literacy in general (Inverarity et al., 2022) and even explicitly placed as its core educational interests (e.g., 
Ghodoosi et al., 2023; Pellegrino & Antelmi, 2023). Yet, only few studies (e.g., ST41; ST43) explicitly separated data science from data 
literacy, suggesting that these terms are largely viewed as synonymous.
A potential emphasis on qualifications in DLE prompts considerations with respect to holistic DLE, particularly with keen interest to 
critical engagement with data(fication), which, according to the results, is most concerned with the agentic notions of subjectification 
for which Biesta (2009, 2020) specifically advocates. Firstly, the underpinning economic rationale, while being a known concern in 
education generally (Biesta, 2009), was visible in DLE through interests in addressing economic needs and growing the number of 
data-wise credentialed individuals with profession-oriented mindsets. Besides the fact that for example increasing human capital (see 
subsection 4.2.5) through students is hardly an educational endeavor, Biesta (2020) emphasized that such approaches place education 
in the realm of “training”, which is an inappropriate starting point for (if not an unimportant component of) holistic education.
A broader scholarly discourse about the temporality of childhood also emerges. DLE objectives towards future data careers and 
societal membership characterize the general idea of students as “becomings” or “adults in the making” (Uprichard, 2008). An 
associated idea is anticipatory socialization, which has been depicted in vocational education and training as the adoption of the norms 
and practices of the existing workforce to be later joined (Colley et al., 2003). While preparing for future roles is not unimportant, the 
underlying issue is solely shaping students based on contemporary norms and non-educational agendas, as well as potentially 
neglecting learning in terms of students’ current “beings” (Uprichard, 2008), that is, how data are currently present in students’ lives. 
On a related note, teaching students to read and use data effectively through structured pedagogy represents a normative and 
deterministic view of data (Pangrazio & Sefton-Green, 2020). Such emphasis may create a one-sided understanding of data(fication), 
including blind spots of societal concerns that have been strongly advocated for (e.g., Markham, 2020; Pangrazio & Selwyn, 2023; 
Sander, 2023), and potentially neglect the empowerment of reflective individuals. In conclusion, a well-rounded approach in DLE calls 
for rigorously incorporating each strand and the many ways the three domains can pertain to them.
5.1.2. Clarity regarding the purposes of DLE
In striving for balance in DLE, it is important to address an observed issue regarding linguistic ambiguity. Notably, slogans such as 
data literacy for “citizenship” or for “navigating” life in data-rich environments (see e.g. subsection 4.1.1) came across as buzzwords 
without clear connections to educational theories or empirical evidence, thus leaving room to be interpreted within virtually any of the 
strands or themes (and thus potentially highly disparate educational intentions). Such generalizations can be perceived as “essentially 
contested concepts” (Gallie, 1955): they represent familiar and noteworthy issues that inherently carry different meanings that may 
also be tied to beliefs and values. Troubling features in such hyperbole—intentional or not—is that it may hide fundamental dis-
agreements or rely on a “common sense” view of education that serves particular interests (Biesta, 2009). To this end, we further 
elaborate three dual meanings within DLE terminology and contemplate their relevance to well-rounded and balanced DLE.
First, “adapting” to data-rich contexts as presented by the literature can be pictured as a dichotomy between conformity and 
autonomy. The present review understands it most essentially according to the first viewpoint, which can mean accommodating to 
data-rich contexts to meet their demands, such as when using everyday devices (e.g., ST25) and avoiding being misled by data (e.g., 
ST57). This view is more about coping or even survival (see subsection 4.1.2), including “becoming” such an individual (see also 
Uprichard, 2008) who fits into the datafied world as it is presented. Being autonomous, in turn, stems from understanding oneself in 
datafication to establish capacity to exercise one’s data agency (e.g., ST22; 4.4.2) as well as seize existing opportunities (e.g., ST32; 
4.3.2). We contend that well-rounded education involves elements from both viewpoints, and students’ considerations of their own 
volitions and dispositions can be central in finding individually meaningful balance (Louie et al., 2022).
“Deriving value” from data can similarly be viewed as more about pursuing social (4.2.5) or personal aspirations (4.3.2), which are 
somewhat different ideas from the perspective of self-formation through education (Biesta, 2009). The premise of harnessing students’ 
data literacy learning efforts to meet predetermined agendas, such as growing the economy (e.g., ST4) or addressing collective needs 
(e.g., ST40) pertains to a more instrumental agenda. While addressing collective issues is important, subjective empowerment as 
promoted by Biesta (2009, 2020) indicates emphasis on the centrality of seeking value from data for transforming one’s individuality 
and subjectivity: using data to inform what is meaningful to oneself (e.g., ST13; ST21; ST39), which, in our view, should not be 
understood to exclude the possibility of socially valuable outputs but is most essentially a shift of priority in the educational intention.
“Participation” in data-rich contexts can have different meanings, including employment and value attainment via existing pos-
sibilities, as discussed above, and reformation (see next subsection). However, here we highlight an additional viewpoint: such civic 
participation that can be understood as the “necessity” to become a qualified contributor to the data-rich community (see subsection 
4.1.2). This suggests the concept of “noocracy”, which holds that only the wise and informed can and should have power. In DLE, this 
can be contextualized to, for instance, preparing for informed policymaking and voting (e.g., ST31). While qualifications may be 
natural requirements for certain forms of meaningful engagement with data environments, such as making use of open data (ST13), the 
potentially controversial issue is about giving (or stifling) voices based on the value placed on the role of skills.
5.1.3. In search of data agency
The previous sections addressed terminological ambiguity in DLE and argued for the cultivation of balance in DLE, which, from the 
perspective of incorporating subjectification specifically, can mean empowering data agency both in everyday life (Carmi et al., 2020; 
Tedre et al., 2020; Valtonen et al., 2019) and in schools (Jarke & Macgilchrist, 2021). The concept of data agency has traditionally been 
J. Fagerlund et al.

Educational Research Review 46 (2025) 100663

associated with such educational ideas that we have mainly positioned within the strand of critical engagement with data(fication). 
Such engagement demonstrated a recognizable continuum that can proceed from competencies about the social and political di-
mensions of data(fication) to their reflection at both general and personal levels (see subsection 4.4.1; see also Dangol & Dasgupta, 
2023; Sander, 2023; Tygel & Kirsch, 2016). Such qualifications could then operate as precursors to exercising data agency, such as 
safely engaging in data-rich environments (see also Gstrein & Beaulieu, 2022). The underlying idea can be viewed as a form of 
“qualified subjectivity”, as also demonstrated by several articles (e.g., ST1; ST22; ST23).
However, “countermaneuvers” against harms may specifically require the acquisition and upkeep of competencies (Pangrazio & 
Sefton-Green, 2020), namely learning to more deeply understand the contexts in which data agency can take place and how it can be 
exercised. Relevant knowledge can concern technical intricacies in the data assemblage (e.g., ST42), intentional and unintentional 
data collection and generation procedures (e.g., ST21–ST23; ST45), and legal data rights (e.g., ST15). Data manipulation, as a concrete 
example, is a technically complex phenomenon, which challenges agency over it (Tygel & Kirsch, 2016). Moreover, individual-level 
choices to protect or resist may conflict with everyday activities, such as social relationships in digital environments (Gstrein & 
Beaulieu, 2022), possibly tempting to suspend personal judgment. Furthermore, the GDPR has been criticized for leaving room for 
interpretation and causing challenges of being sufficiently informed to withhold consent or holding onto one’s rights (Pangrazio & 
Sefton-Green, 2020).
Although regulation such as the DSA shows promise in providing, for instance, the power to disable profiling algorithms on large 
social media platforms, it relies on informed subject-level counter-strategies; a shift of control and responsibility from the system to the 
individual (Pangrazio & Sefton-Green, 2020). That being said, a rather deep educational aim in the context of data agency is to 
empower reformation (see also Loftus & Madden, 2020), which can be viewed as transforming socialization through individual agents 
of change, as also articulated by Paulo Freire (see Tygel & Kirsch, 2016). While this level of agency for change may be the most 
desirable and impactful for society to, for instance, build emancipatory technologies (e.g., ST5), it may also be the most demanding for 
both individuals to carry out and the educational process to foster, especially at the K–12 level. In other words, while data agency 
appears to possess a pivotal educational function, particularly in terms of critical engagement with data(fication), its feasibility in 
educational practice remains somewhat uncertain.
Conversely, self-actualization in data environments (4.4.3) presents a more profound (and, in theory, a straightforward) 
perspective of data agency (see also Jansen, 2021), involving decision-making based on a deeper engagement of identity, values, and 
wants. For example, deciding whether or not to participate in data-gathering platforms (e.g., ST22; ST44) does not necessarily require 
extensive knowledge; inability does not eliminate the possibility of making a choice. However, understanding data(fication) can serve 
the awareness that a choice is available or, thereafter, the making of an informed choice, thus (re-)emphasizing the role of qualifi-
cations in DLE. In alignment with Biesta’s (2022) philosophy, however, we emphasize self-actualization not solely in the context of 
critical engagement with data(fication), but more generally the self-determination of why students themselves want to learn. Agency in 
DLE can thus be understood as an even more profound concept; one that prompts opening the world of data(fication) and most 
pivotally its educational directions (i.e., the strands) to students for them to shape their own educational paths.
5.2. Implications of the study
Although the findings should be viewed mainly as ways of conceptualizing the versatile educational purposes of DLE rather than a 
recipe for how to organize excellent education (e.g., Franch, 2020; cf. Lomsdal et al., 2023), the results can concretely inform 
educational decision-making. We underscore that balance is generally advisable for well-rounded education (Biesta, 2009), high-
lighting the importance of nurturing all the themes and strands and their connections. Educational contexts may have unique goals, 
priorities, and value priorities (Biesta, 2009), making it difficult to provide a silver bullet. Generally, introducing students to the DLE 
strands and their meanings could promote a “world-centred approach” in education as prompted by Biesta (2022); empowering 
students to learn to exist “in” and “with” the world in their own right.
This review investigated the broad question of “why” DLE in K–12. Although DLE is developing in terms of its key paradigms, an 
overview of its practical implementation is lacking, including the educational opportunities and challenges associated with its 
multifaceted nature (see also Ghodoosi et al., 2023). As this review produced an overview the connected purposes of DLE, subsequent 
studies could adopt more aggregative or experimental approaches to further investigate the enactment of DLE through pedagogical 
activities in classrooms; the questions of “what” and “how” to inform, for example, curricular guidelines, while heeding DLE’s observed 
pluralism. Another interesting prospect is to utilize the findings to examine policy rhetoric or differences in research designs in terms of 
their DLE foci to potentially discover emphases, underrepresentations, and priorities, as well as to highlight the (scholarly and/or 
political) paradigms and origins of different DLE goals shaping the discourse in this topic.
We view that further empirical research is needed especially to explore the practical dimensions of subjectification-focused DLE 
and its notable co-dependencies with qualification and particular tensions with socialization (e.g., conformity versus autonomy). 
Notably, developing instructional practices that explicitly “produce” subjectification may not be straightforward, but could emerge 
when emphasizing the centrality of the students’ subjectivity (Dangol & Dasgupta, 2023; Loftus & Madden, 2020). Whether the aim is 
more about coping, training, personal value, or critical engagement, students could be considered not only as their future “becomings” 
(Colley et al., 2003), but also as their current “beings” (Uprichard, 2008). They can emerge in such subjective presence, for instance, by 
reflecting on data opportunities and data contexts currently present in their lives and harnessing and reconfiguring them in meaningful 
ways. For instance, arts-based methods (e.g., Forster et al., 2018; Vacca et al., 2022a) and autoethnographic tools (Pronzato & 
Markham, 2023) could complement or contribute to both interest-driven inquiries (Ridsdale et al., 2015) and, especially from the 
viewpoint of critical engagement, revelations of power hegemonies in local data contexts, for instance, and foster the design of 
J. Fagerlund et al.

alternative solutions (Stornaiuolo, 2020).
5.3. Limitations
Although our study provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge its limitations. As is typical of qualitative approaches 
(Whittemore & Knafl, 2005), this review did not quantify the themes to examine their distributions statistically or for making com-
parisons. A related limitation intrinsic to the approach is that a specific theoretical viewpoint omits other pertinent aspects, 
encouraging the adoption of other approaches to diversify the perspective.
With respect to the literature search protocol, searching with the term “data literacy” may have resulted in the exclusion of some 
relevant literature whereas terms such as “data education” or “media literacy”, for instance, could have yielded additional results. 
Furthermore, we excluded non-English literature and other than peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers, which may 
have included some relevant information. These matters are not considered extremely problematic, however, since the retrieved 
examples provided a rather diverse perspective.
Articulations in research papers are the products of academic writing and publishing processes, influenced by writing style, 
audience, journal guidelines, and editing. Study foci also determine how ideas are formulated. Such matters affect the interpretation of 
concepts, highlighting how texts are important vehicles for educational debate and reasoning. Notably, our findings represent different 
overall perspectives on DLE rather than directly indicate positioning regarding it in individual papers. This was mainly due to a 
recognized need to develop theoretical categories for subsequent systematic and reliable objective compilation that can cover a wide 
range of rhetoric and a variety of abstractions and thus overcome the initial difficulty of interpretation. We also wish to note that 
although there occasionally was positioning to particular viewpoints in the literature, many studies merely highlighted the diversity of 
DLE by arguing from different perspectives, as is inherent to scholarly argumentation.
6. Concluding remarks
This review responded to the call for examining what kinds of ideas of DLE have been made visible (Jansen, 2021) and, by 
examining them through the lens of well-rounded education (Biesta, 2009), revealed the demand for multifaceted approaches to 
support students’ holistic growth in a data-rich society. The results aggregated diverse purposes for DLE that addressed both personal 
and collective realms, including aims to adapt as well as exercise autonomy amidst the complex manifestations of data in modern 
societies. Especially the notion of critical engagement with data(fication) has been recently underscored amidst the rise of the 
commodification of personal data and threats to data privacy; when and how to adapt, or when and how data independence can 
emerge, although particular limits were discernible, such as a degree of necessity in the need to conform to the data-intensive world, 
given that it is difficult to be completely detached from social reality.
While the educational benefits of all DLE strands are evident, education that emphasizes especially practical-instrumental data 
learning, as may be the somewhat higher priority in contemporary education, can pressure all stakeholders to prioritize academic 
achievement at the cost of subjective growth. Even if such emphasis is not explicitly enacted, students may absorb such influences 
amidst pro-data practices, such as when using learning analytics (Mertala, 2020). Although agency may emerge tacitly in various ways 
even in traditional data science learning, skill-centric views have largely prevailed in broad discussions about educational purposes in 
general (Biesta, 2009, 2015). It is understandable, though, that skills are easier to outline in discourse about, for instance, learning 
objectives and assessment (see e.g., Cui et al., 2023). That being said, it is important to ensure that they distinctly encompass also those 
related to the social and political dimensions of data(fication). Regardless, the risk that what is easier to define and measure will be 
more valued (Eynon, 2022) may have already been incurred, and this review gives further impetus to considering how constitutional 
educational processes, such as curricular development, could complement skill-based ends more resolutely with agency-based intents.
The breadth of competencies required in critical data literacy, as well as the necessity of sometimes assimilating into existing data 
environments, seems to pose a challenging balance. With respect to the ongoing perhaps slightly polarized debates on data literacy 
directions, a pluralistic approach that reconciles competency, conformity, and agency in DLE seems favorable; a middle ground be-
tween the (unrealistic) extremes of viewing data as the ultimate frontier of knowledge and a dystopian vision of panopticon-like 
dataveillance that requires full cover (see also Raffaghelli et al., 2022). Ultimately, it is up to a local negotiation of values where 
the formation of individual students should be the focus of deliberation (Biesta, 2009). Consequently, educators should be aware of 
their own underlying intentions and take responsibility for their endeavors (Biesta, 2015).
