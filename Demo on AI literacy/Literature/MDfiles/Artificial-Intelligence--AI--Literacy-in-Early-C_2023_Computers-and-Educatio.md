Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy has become an emerging topic in digital literacy education 
research. However, it is still under-explored in early childhood education (ECE) since the AI curriculum for 
young children has just been designed in recent years. A scoping review was conducted to examine the thematic 
and content analysis of 16 empirical papers from 2016 to 2022. This scoping reviews evaluate, synthesize, and 
display 16 studies on AI literacy in early childhood education, including curriculum design, AI tools, pedagogical 
approaches, research designs, assessment methods, and findings. The discussion of the AI literacy implementa-
tion in ECE contributes to providing references for educators and researchers to design interventions to engage 
young children in AI learning. Further, we identified a set of challenges and opportunities of AI literacy. Several 
challenges included (1) lack of teachers’ AI knowledge, skills, and confidence; (2) lack of curriculum design; and 
(3) lack of teaching guidelines. Although educators meet challenges at the beginning stage of developing AI 
instructional design for young children, AI learning could bring learning opportunities and foster young chil-
dren’s AI literacy in terms of AI concepts, practices and perspectives. We foresee that there will be a growing 
number of age-appropriate curriculum and tools for the ECE level. At the end, we also make some recommen-
dations for future researchers and educators to improve AI literacy research and learning design in early 
childhood education.   
1. Introduction 
In 1956, artificial intelligence (AI) was defined as “the science and 
engineering of creating intelligent machines” (Mc Carthy, 2007). AI re-
fers to the science and engineering of making intelligent machines that 
solve different kinds of problems via natural language processing, neural 
network and machine learning (Mondal, 2020). It is transforming every 
walks of life such as medicine, psychology, science and public policy (Xu 
et al., 2021). In educational fields, AI can help teachers to predict stu-
dents’ learning status and performance, recommend learning resources, 
and automate assessments to improve students’ learning experience via 
intelligent agent systems, chatbots, and recommendation systems (Liang 
et al., 2021; Mousavinasab et al., 2021; Su et al., 2022; Zawacki-Richter 
et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2021). 
Young children are growing up with these AI applications, yet little 
attention is paid to the important of developing AI literacy and its 
related impacts among them. They use AI products such as chatbots and 
recommendation tools to facilitate their everyday lives and study. 
Children may not know how to use AI, and the basic working principles 
behind these tools and they may have misconceptions about the tech-
nologies. Moreover, AI may threaten their safety when it gives wrong 
and misleading information or suggestions (Gaube et al., 2021). 
Therefore, it is necessary to develop young children’s AI literacy, 
especially its limitations, ethical concerns and basic understanding 
about the technology (Kong et al., 2021, 2022; Long & Magerko, 2020; 
Ng et al., 2021a, b). 
Recent researchers proposed the term “AI literacy” to put forth the 
importance of adding AI to the 21st century digital literacy skills for 
everyone, including young children (Ng et al., 2021a, b). Learning 
programs and activities (e.g., Jibo robot, Anki’s Cozmo robot) emerged 
to focus on how to foster young children’s AI understandings and atti-
tudes (Druga et al., 2021). AI literacy has become an essential literacy 
skill that is required for everyone (including young children) to know 
and use AI as a tool to live, learn, and work in our digital world, and it 
should be taught in grades K-12 (Burgsteiner et al., 2016; Kandlhofer 
et al., 2016; Ng et al., 2021a, b; Steinbauer et al., 2021). On top of 
merely becoming end users of AI tools, AI literacy is a set of compe-
tencies that enables people to critically evaluate, communicate and

collaborate effectively with AI (Druga et al., 2021). Scholars started to 
suggest different models to conceptualize the term AI literacy (Ng et al., 
2021b; Touretzky et al., 2019). For example, Touretzky et al. (2019) 
proposed the use of five big ideas about AI: (1) Computers perceive the 
world using sensors, (2) Agents maintain models/representations of the 
world and use them for reasoning, (3) Making agents interact comfort-
ably with humans is a substantial challenge for AI developers, (4) 
Computers can learn from data, and (5) AI applications can impact so-
ciety in both positive and negative ways. Ng et al. (2021b) further 
designed a framework of AI concepts, practices and perspectives that 
interplay between CT and AI that students can learn machine learning 
knowledge, model training skills, collaboration and communication 
skills. 
In the past, AI learning began in university computer science edu-
cation, which required advanced programming skills that were inap-
propriate for children decades ago (Ng et al., 2021a). Recently, the 
development of more age-appropriate software has enabled young 
learners to extend their possibilities to learn and explore AI. The ma-
jority of current AI literacy research focuses on secondary or higher 
education (Ng & Chu, 2021; Kong et al., 2021; Eguchi et al., 2021; Su 
et al., 2022). For example, non-computer science undergraduates and 
secondary students started to develop AI concepts and ethical awareness 
to empower them to become educated digital citizens (Kong et al., 2023; 
Ng & Chu, 2021). However, these courses do not focus on complex 
computer science concepts or mathematical formulas. Instead, the 
courses enabled students to develop basic understanding of AI concepts, 
literacy and confidence of using AI (Kong et al., 2022; Ng et al., 2022a). 
In early childhood education, AI-powered toys are made to provide 
students with a playful experience to learn and interact with the robots 
and kits, and teach coding skills. With more well-designed AI toys and 
services, young children could develop their AI literacy even at a 
kindergarten level. They experience AI-driven robotic toys and services 
(e.g., Pop Bots, Quickdraw) (Williams, 2018; Williams et al., 2019a,b) to 
explore AI related concepts (e.g., knowledge-based systems, supervised 
machine learning, generative AI). Although young children may not 
know and understand the knowledge behind, they can explore and 
appreciate these AI technologies, and foster their digital literacy in their 
everyday lives. 
Some may challenge whether kindergarteners and junior primary 
students are too young to explore and learn AI knowledge (Su et al., 
2022). However, previous studies have brought AI tools into early 
childhood education (ECE) classrooms and shown their promising ef-
fects (e.g., Lin et al., 2020; Tseng et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2019). In 
fact, early AI literacy is important for young children to improve many 
aspects of child development, such as theory of mind skills, creative 
inquiry, emotional inquiry and collaborative inquiry (Kewalramani 
et al., 2021; Su & Yang, 2022). For example, Kewalramani et al. (2021) 
investigated the use of interactive AI to cultivate inquiry literacy in early 
childhood education settings. However, only a few research efforts had 
been done on how AI literacy for children aged 3–8 years in ECE level 
relative to other age groups (e.g, primary 3-6, secondary education) to 
support the potential of AI literacy education for ECE settings. So far, 
only one review study has tried to discuss using AI in ECE settings (Su & 
Yang, 2022). However, this review did not discuss the mapping of 
existing learning outcomes, assessment methods, as well as opportu-
nities and challenges of AI literacy in ECE settings (Su & Yang, 2022). 
2. Literature review 
This scoping review provides a starting point for early childhood 
researchers and educators in terms of promoting research and practice 
related to AI literacy education. This section first reviews the current 
status of both using AI, and the importance of AI literacy in early 
childhood education. 
2.1. Artificial intelligence 
Recent years, a growing number of researchers have started to 
discuss how to teach and learn AI from K-12 to higher education. 
Although the AI-related ECE studies is still in its infancy, researchers 
have started to discover how AI applications is used to facilitate 
kindergarten teachers’ administration and students’ learning through 
intelligent tutoring systems for special education, chatbots for language 
education, and robotic kits in Computer Science education (e.g., Chen 
et al., 2020; Su & Yang, 2022). These AI applications facilitate students 
in computer-supported collaborative learning, teaching automation and 
evaluation, detecting learners’ emotions, and recommend useful mate-
rials for students. Several facts were uncovered in Chen et al. (2020)’s 
paper about how to use AI technologies in the educational industry. 
Although a growing interest in and the impact of research on AI in ed-
ucation are identified, further effort is necessary to inform how to 
integrate advanced AI techniques and deep learning technologies into 
educational settings. Also, there exists a scarce number of studies that 
drive the use of AI technologies into educational theories. This is 
consistent with another review conducted by Hwang et al. (2021), which 
categorised AI applications into four general roles, including intelligent 
tutor, tutee, learning tool/partner, and policy-making advisor. 
In early childhood education, educators tried to explore the use of 
AIED technologies to facilitate their work and enhance students’ 
learning. For example, Jin (2019) explored the potential of AI applica-
tions in four examples: AI evaluation of children, AI teaching system, AI 
educational robot, and AI virtual reality teaching, and further proposed 
the use of AI in family education and enhanced parental knowledge. Lin 
et al. (2020) interacted with a dialogue system that enabled students to 
interact with the chatbots to enhance language learning and visualiza-
tion training. Nan (2020) used an AI teaching system to motivate stu-
dents’ learning in a collaborative AI-assisted environment and stimulate 
children’s interest in learning. These studies provide ample evidence to 
show the effectiveness of using AIED technologies at kindergarten level. 
Furthermore, it is essential to equip children with digital skills and 
mindsets to get them ready for future studies and facilitate their 
everyday living. 
2.2. AI literacy 
The term “AI literacy” was first coined by Burgsteiner et al. (2016) 
and Kandlhofer et al. (2016) who describes the competencies to un-
derstand the basic knowledge and concepts about AI. On top of this, 
Long and Magerko (2020) defined it as a set of competencies that en-
ables individuals to critically evaluate, communicate and collaborate 
effectively with AI; and use AI as a tool online, at home, and in the 
workplace. Further, Ng et al. (2021a, b) added AI to every student’s 
twenty-first century digital literacy in work settings and everyday life, 
and proposed it as a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for com-
puter scientists. He widely incorporated the model of Bloom Taxonomy, 
Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), and AI con-
cepts, practices, and perspectives into the instructional design of AI 
literacy education. 
2.3. AI literacy in ECE 
AI education has posed challenges and opportunities to early child-
hood education (or kindergarten education), including why young 
learners should learn AI in their early years, the subset of key AI con-
cepts that can be understood by children, and how children were 
engaged in a meaningful experience for them to acquire these concepts 
(Yang, 2022). He pointed out several reasons why young children need 
to learn AI: (1) knowing and understanding the basic competencies of AI 
and using AI applications is important for all citizens to become AI lit-
erates in today’s digital world (Ng et al., 2021a, b); (2) children need to 
be empowered to understand, use, and evaluate AI with purposeful

guidance (Williams et al., 2019a); (3) children should have the capa-
bility to understand the basic functions of AI, especially when more 
well-designed AI toys appear in their everyday experience (Kewalra-
mani et al., 2021). Su and Yang (2022) further identified AI in ECE 
studies that have introduced AI concepts to kindergarteners using AI 
learning tools such as Pop Bots and Zhorai. 
Few prior researchers proposed what young children should learn 
and how to scaffold them to understand how AI senses, perceives, in-
teracts, behaves and creates. Yang (2022) designed an “AI for Kids” 
Curriculum for young children to help them “highlight the role of 
AI-powered technologies in human’s daily life and to enable children to 
learn about AI using an embodied, project-based approach” through AI 
toys, AI for Ocean at code.org and Quickdraw. Williams et al. (2019a) 
designed an AI-interfaced robot for young children to help them 
appreciate the abilities and limitations of AI agents and toys. Students 
can develop their relationships with these toys to learn knowledge-based 
systems, supervised machine learning, and generative AI through 
Rock-Paper-Scissors game, Food Classification, Music Remix activities. 
Through these age-appropriate activities and tools, students could 
recognise the basic knowledge about AI and understand the ethical is-
sues and limitations behind these tools. These studies provide the 
rationale and practices on how teachers can scaffold young children’s 
understanding using these age-appropriate activities and tools (Ng et al., 
2022c; Su & Yang, 2022; Yang, 2022). 
3. Methods 
To our knowledge, there has been no existing review conducted to 
examine AI literacy in early childhood education. As such, the over-
arching goal of this review is to evaluate existing literature and identify 
challenges and opportunities of AI literacy in early childhood education. 
The review approach is based on Arksey and O’Malley’s (2005) 
Fig. 1. PRISMA diagram of included articles in the scoping review.  
J. Su et al.

five-stage framework, which employs a rigorous transparency process to 
improve the reliability of the research findings. The five steps of Arksey 
and O’Malley’s framework were used in this review of the literature on 
early AI literacy: (1) identifying initial research questions, (2) identi-
fying the relevant studies, (3) selecting studies, (4) charting the data, 
and (5) collating. 
3.1. Identify the relevant studies 
According to Arksey and O’Malley (2005), a broad definition of 
keywords for search terms should be used to obtain a ‘broad coverage’ of 
existing literature. Keywords and search terms were investigated in 
existing literature on early AI literacy from international perspectives. 
The electronic databases used for the literature search included Web of 
Science, EBSCO, IEEE, ACM, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The search 
was limited to studies written in English. All articles are accessed in May 
2022. To facilitate database search, this study investigated 
peer-reviewed academic articles published until May 2022. We formu-
lated a search string based on our understanding of and knowledge in 
the AI in early childhood education domain and also, by referring to 
related AI education search strings used in other studies such as Su, Yim, 
et al. (2022). The search string used for the review was: “AI literacy” OR 
“Artificial intelligence literacy” AND “early childhood” OR “young 
child*” OR “preschool*” OR “kindergarten*” OR “pre-k*” OR “child-
care” OR “child care” OR “day care” OR “children”. 
3.2. Study selection 
Using the author key search descriptors, 430 articles were identified. 
As shown in Fig. 1, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement was followed during the article 
selection process (Moher et al., 2009). This paper focuses on artificial 
intelligence literacy in early childhood education. 430 articles were 
found in the Web of Science, EBSCO, IEEE, ACM, Scopus, and Google 
Scholar [1 from Web of Science, 4 from EBSCO, 6 from IEEE, 1 from 
ACM, 15 from Scopus and 403 from Google Scholar (n = 430)]. 
The following articles were excluded from the study: the first 
exclusion criteria (E1) was articles that were not related to research title 
and abstract (n = 390). We excluded 390 results due to their irrelevance 
to the research topic: (a) whose focus was other topics, such as AI 
technologies, medical, etc (n = 209); (b) whose focus was primary 3-6, 
secondary, and colleges/university students (n = 181). The second 
exclusion criteria (E2) was duplicate studies (n = 15). The third exclu-
sion criteria (E3) was papers in which the participants or settings were 
not 3–8 years old (n = 1). Furthermore, the fourth exclusion criteria (E4) 
was papers whose focus/topic was not early artificial intelligence liter-
acy (n = 7). The last exclusion criteria (E5) was papers that were non- 
English language studies (n = 1). 
3.3. Data charting and collation 
The charting of selected articles is the last step in Arksey and 
O’Malley’s (2005) review framework. The 16 articles that focused on AI 
literacy in ECE were thoroughly reviewed (2016, 1 article; 2018, 1 
article; 2019, 3 articles; 2020, 2 articles; 2021, 4 articles, and 2022, 5 
articles). 
Research design. The research designs adopted in AI literacy in 
early childhood education studies are shown in Table 1. Most studies 
used a quantitative design (6 articles) and qualitative design (6 articles), 
followed by a mixed-research design (2 articles). The six quantitative 
studies applied various data collection procedures, such as knowledge 
and theory of mind skills assessments, questionnaires, and surveys. For 
example, Lin et al. (2020) used assessments (i.e., knowledge test) to 
examine children’s machine learning knowledge through Zhorai. Re-
sults show that children can understand machine learning concepts 
more easily using the tool. The four qualitative studies used various data 
collection methods through collecting videos, pictures, field notes, 
comments, interviews, and observations. For example, Kandlhofer et al. 
(2016) used observation and interview to assess children’s AI develop-
ment. Results show that they were very successful in introducing basic 
AI/computer science concepts to children in a playful way. The rest of 
the papers used mixed research methods to collect data through various 
procedures, such as machine learning metric, training data, pre/post 
perception game responses, and observations. Two articles (Su & Zhong, 
2022; Yang, 2022), only introduced and described their AI curricula in 
ECE, without implementing them in practice, and thus no data was 
collected. More details are shown in Appendix 1. 
Countries/Regions. This review shows that all studies were con-
ducted in developed countries/regions (e.g., United States, Austria, 
Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia). As a 
result, we conclude that this type of article is strong enough to provide 
effective AI literacy research in ECE fields, representing AI educational 
articles from various countries. More characteristics of the included 
studies, such as research design, curriculum design, participants, tools, 
and country can be found in Appendix 1. 
4. Classification and taxonomy of AI literacy in ECE settings 
According to Ng et al. (2021a, b), AI literacy instructional design can 
be developed in terms of pedagogy, content knowledge, tools and 
assessment methods used. This review examined instructional design, 
tools, assessment methods and added learning outcomes that we found 
in the past studies, as shown in Appendix 1, according to the three 
research questions. This study first lists the instructional designs that 
have been used in the past studies, including design-based research 
(DBR) approach and interaction with AI robots. Then, it summarised the 
tools used in the AI literacy courses. The second RQ aims to examine the 
assessment methods such as knowledge/skill-based assessment, ques-
tionnaire and observations. The third RQ aims to review how prior 
studies examine young children’s knowledge, concepts, skills and atti-
tudes towards AI literacy. 
With the coding framework, the selected articles were analysed in 
terms of its definitions and technologies used. The text segments were

extracted and coded under a coding scheme (see Table 2) and re-
searchers could discuss any disagreements resolved and reach a final 
decision. After validating the coding processes and categorisation, the 
findings were then descriptively summarised according to its frequency 
and identified themes. This paper focuses on the instructional design, 
tools, assessment methods and learning outcomes which contributes 
researchers, educators and policy makers to designing and improving 
the existing AI education practices and curricula to best foster young 
children’s AI literacy. Therefore, this review study adopts the frame-
work of AI literacy in ECE studies in terms of learning design, assessment 
methods, and learning outcomes (Fig. 2). 
The first and second authors are coded all included articles filled in a 
table separately. Information about learning design, assessment 
methods, and learning outcomes were filled in by researchers. Differ-
ences between the first two researchers’ responses were then compared 
and discussed, leading to the revision of tables. 
4.1. The purpose of the study 
This study contributes to a timely review of the current development 
of the AI literacy education and offers guidance to researchers who are 
seeking suitable activities to engage kindergarteners (e.g., Su & Yang, 
2022; Yang, 2022). The review also provides a reference for policy-
makers, who must make critical decisions regarding future development 
to set the educational standards. The examination of prior research in 
the field also helps researchers to determine which subjects are of 
continuing importance. There are few studies in the fields of AI literacy 
education in ECE settings. In these studies, researchers focus on topics 
such as pedagogies, content knowledge, and technologies to uncover 
what, why and how to teach AI literacy for young learners (Yang, 2022). 
But reviews of research on AI literacy in ECE are less common and this 
seems to be no review studies summarizing how educators develop 
young children literacy in terms of age-appropriate instructional design 
and tools, and what types of assessment methods have been used to 
examine their AI literacy in the early AI curriculum, as well as its 
learning outcomes throughout the interventions in ECE settings. To fill 
these gaps in the literature, we present a scoping review of the literature 
on AI literacy in ECE. The present study systematically analyses and 
discusses existing works from the aspects of instructional design, tools, 
assessment methods and learning outcomes. Meanwhile, this study 
concentrates on the challenges and opportunities for AI to assist edu-
cators or researchers in locating relevant and important information in 
ECE. 
Our review focused on key aspects of the challenges and opportu-
nities of improving AI literacy in early childhood education. The 
following are three research questions to help guide our search. 
5. Results 
RQ1.
How do researchers help young children develop AI literacy in 
terms of instructional design and tools? 
This section summarises how researchers design their instruction to 
develop young children’s AI literacy in terms of learning content, tools, 
length of intervention and pedagogical design. 
Learning content. First, it is important to review the learning con-
tents in the curriculum design in the studies, which offer a basis for 
educators to design their curriculum and programs for their students. 
Although kindergarteners may not understand the working principles 
behind the AI concepts, young children can attempt to understand these 
concepts through playful experience such as knowledge-based systems, 
supervised machine learning, and generative AI (Williams et al., 2019a). 
What does AI know, teaching AI robots to conduct tasks, experiencing 
machine learning, and its ethical concerns (Lin et al., 2020). Based on 
the suggested learning contents, future educators can know what 
knowledge content is suitable for young children to learn and experience 
as shown in Table 3. 
AI tools. In our review, 14 out of 16 studies engage young children to 
use AI tools/platforms to learn AI, as shown in Table 4. Among the 
studies, three of them used Pop Bots to foster kindergarten children’s 
basic AI understandings and concepts such as knowledge-based systems, 
supervised machine learning, and generative AI (Williams, 2018; Wil-
liams et al., 2019a, b). Other AI tools/platforms reported in the studies 
include Jibo robot, Anki’s Cozmo robot, Amazon’s Alexa, Zhorai, Cog-
nimates AI platform, Google’s Teachable Machine, Cosmo, Blue Bot, Coji 
by Wowee, Qobo the snail, and vernie-Lego Boost Bot. Furthermore, one

study found that a conversational platform (Zhorai) can help children to 
understand machine learning concepts (Lin et al., 2020). Teaching 
young children AI was not possible in the past. However, with these 
tools, kindergarten teachers start to explore ways to engage students to 
experience AI which aims to enhance their technological skills that can 
facilitate their learning and living. More characteristics of the AI tools, 
such as categories, information, details, and country, can be found in 
Table 5. 
Length of learning programs. Overall, the learning journey is quite 
short for students to learn AI as shown in Table 3. Only two of the studies 
have a longer intervention over weeks (Druga & Ko, 2021; Druga et al., 
2022). Six studies engage students in short learning programs within 
1–4 h (e.g., Williams et al., 2019a, b; Lin et al., 2020). Future studies are 
necessary to consider longer interventions to foster students’ AI literacy. 
Pedagogy design. In terms of the pedagogy design used, studies 
have used various approaches. The two most commonly used pedagogies 
are activity-based learning (n = 4) and experiential learning (n = 3). 
“The activity-based approach has constructivist aims, and exploits both 
collaborative interaction and access to information-rich resources” 
(Macdonald & Twining, 2002, p. 604). Firstly, researchers found that 
hands-on activities could help students explore AI concepts effectively 
(e.g., Druga et al., 2019; Williams, 2018, Williams et al., 2019a). 
Through hands-on experience, students can experience how AI works in 
robots and toys (i.e., knowledge-based systems, supervised machine 
learning, generative AI) in order to enhance children’s AI literacy 
(Williams, 2018; Williams et al., 2019a). Secondly, experiential learning 
encourages students to learn by doing through hands-on experiences and 
reflection that connect theories and knowledge learned in the classroom 
to real-world situations (Morris, 2020). In our review, Kewalramani 
et al. (2021) designed experiential AI learning activities through 
engaging 4-5-year-old children in playing with Vernie robots, thereby 
increasing children’s three literacy skills (i.e., create inquiry literacy, 
emotional inquiry literacy, and collaborative inquiry literacy). Children 
playing with AI toys can explore their creative thinking and under-
standing of robots (creative inquiry literacy). Creative inquiry literacy 
means “throughout their play with AI toys, the children were exposed to 
many mediums through which they could explore and express their 
creative thinking and understand-ing of robots” (Kewalramani et al., 
2021, p.659). The two pedagogies could enable students to learn and 
experience AI although it is not necessary for young learners to know 
and understand the working principles behind AI. 
Lastly, only a few researchers (n = 2) in the AI field have designed 
projects to improve young children’s higher-order thinking skills (e.g., 
communication, collaboration, and computational thinking skills) 
(Druga et al., 2019; Tseng et al., 2021). For example, Druga et al. (2019) 
designed play and talk to AI agents (i.e., Alexa home assistant, Jibo and 
Cozmo robots) activities and children were invited to draw AI agents in 
the future. It is understandable that young children may not be able to 
learn much AI concepts and knowledge, but it is important to facilitate 
young students to use AI to communicate and collaborate with other 
classmates. To sum up, educators can consider the three pedagogical 
approaches (i.e., activity-based learning, experiential learning, and 
hands-on experience) to encourage young children to experience how AI 
works, know how to use AI tools, communicate and collaborate with 
others using AI, which facilitate their learning and living in today’s 
digital world. Activity-based learning is based on “the constructivist 
learning approach, supports children throughout the learning process 
with activities they do themselves” (Metin, 2020, p. 151). Experiential 
learning means “knowledge creation resulting from reflection on and 
during experience, and its acknowledgement of the importance of 
learning processes and not simply behavioural outcomes” (Kolb, 2014, 
p. 26). Hands-on learning refers to learning by doing (Niiranen, 2021). 
Hands-on activities are important in children’s learning (Kim, 2020). 
RQ2.
What were the assessment methods to examine young children’s 
AI literacy in the early AI curriculum? 
Regarding the assessment methods used for evaluating young chil-
dren’s AI knowledge and skills, three data collection techniques, 
including knowledge and theory of mind assessments (4 articles), 
questionnaires and observation (3 articles), as shown in Table 5. It 
should be noted that although there were some overlaps between 
different assessment methods, this paper quotes the names used in the 
reviewed papers directly. 
Different assessment methods were employed for examining young 
children’s learning effects, such as knowledge and theory of mind skills 
assessment. Particular knowledge assessments were designed and 
developed for evaluating young children’s AI knowledge (Table 6). For 
example, a number of studies used knowledge assessments to assess 
children’s AI concepts/knowledge (Lin et al., 2020; Williams, 2018; 
Williams et al., 2019a, b) (see Table 4). For example, Williams et al. 
(2019a,b) and Williams (2018) used three activities (i.e., Rock--
Paper-Scissors, Food Classification, Music Remix activities) to evaluate 
children’s different AI knowledge (i.e., knowledge-based systems, su-
pervised ML, and generative AI). Results show that AI curriculum helped 
children improve three concepts, such as knowledge-based systems, 
supervised ML, and generative AI. 
The questionnaires included AI perception questionnaire and 
perception of robots questionnaire (Table 7). The AI perception ques-
tionnaires include several dimensions, including intelligence attribu-
tion, truthfulness attribution, and perceived understanding (Druga et al., 
2019). Druga et al. (2019) developed an AI perception questionnaire for 
assessing children’s feelings about the agents (i.e., Jibo robot, Anki’s 
Cozmo robot and Amazon’s Alexa, home assistant). The researchers 
found that 68% of children thought the agents understood them the 
most. 
Different observations were employed for examining children’s 
learning effects, such as observations of learning activities, young chil-
dren’s and educators’ play experiences, and interaction with AI robotics 
(Table 8). For example, some researchers designed one activity about 
interacting with an AI robot (Ro Bo Ho N) and used observation to observe 
children’s interaction with Ro Bon Ho N. Results show that children 
engaged in experiences that promoted the development of non-cognitive 
abilities” (Tazume et al., 2020, p. 323). “Interactions with AI robots are 
more similar to human communication than to communication with 
other media, and this may affect the development of non-cognitive 
abilities” (Tazume et al., 2020, p. 328). 
RQ3.
What were the learning outcomes of AI literacy in ECE settings? 
Most studies revealed that the AI curriculum was effective in terms of 
enhancing young children’s knowledge and skills, which facilitate 
young children to use AI tools for learning and living purposes. This 
section summarised the learning outcomes in terms of knowledge gain 
and skill acquisition (see Table 9). 
In terms of knowledge gain, AI curricula have significantly improved 
children’s AI concepts, such as knowledge-based systems, supervised 
ML, and generative AI (Williams, 2018; Williams et al., 2019a,b) and 
knowledge about machine learning (Lin et al., 2020; Tseng et al., 2021). 
It was discovered that children can understand three AI concepts, such 
as rule-based systems, supervised machine learning, and generative AI 
after basic AI courses. After online workshops, children know the ma-
chine learning concepts/knowledge (Tseng et al., 2021). Moreover, 
young children can improve their skills, such as theory of mind skills 
(Williams, 2018; Williams et al., 2019a,b) and creative inquiry, 
emotional inquiry and collaborative inquiry (Kewalramani et al., 2021). 
For example, Kewalramani et al. (2021) designed interactive learning 
activities among children to play with robots. Results show that children 
increased creative inquiry, emotional inquiry and collaborative inquiry 
after the AI activities. However, none of the research discusses how AI 
learning programs affect young children’s affective learning outcomes 
such as attitudes, motivation, and confidence of using AI. Future 
research is necessary to examine how students gain their affective 
learning outcomes.

6. Discussion 
This paper provides a review of AI literacy studies in early childhood 
education, focusing on the characteristics and features of AI literacy as 
well as the effectiveness of interventions. Although there were few 
empirical studies on AI literacy for ECE, the existing references did 
provide new insights into various aspects of AI literacy for young chil-
dren. Our work contributes several new insights into AI literacies in 
early childhood education by addressing three research questions. 
Based on the examination of AI curriculum designs in the reviewed 
studies, several findings were identified. Firstly, most studies used age- 
appropriate learning tools or platforms to enhance young children’s 
learning AI. Robotic kits, especially Pop Bots, is the most common tool to 
enhance children’s basic AI concepts (n = 3) (Williams, 2018; Williams 
et al., 2019a,b). 
Secondly, in terms of pedagogy design, researchers design different 
learning activities to increase children’s AI knowledge and concepts 
(Williams, 2018; Williams et al., 2019a,b; Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Lin

et al., 2020; Druga & Ko, 2021). For example, Williams (2018) and 
Williams et al. (2019a) designed three learning activities to promote 
children’s three basic AI concepts, such as knowledge-based systems, 
supervised machine learning, and generative AI. Most studies found that 
AI education in kindergarten, primary 3-6, secondary, and higher edu-
cation are very different. Children ages 3–8 years old only understand 
basic AI concepts (Su & Zhong, 2022). 
Thirdly, for young children’s learning outcomes, most of the studies 
were focused on examining young children’s improvement in terms of AI 
or machine learning knowledge after their participation in the inter-
vention. In addition to AI or machine learning knowledge, children’s 
skills including creative inquiry, emotional inquiry, and collaborative 
inquiry, were improved after learning AI curricula (Kewalramani et al., 
2021; Williams et al., 2019a). Findings show that children (3–8 years 
old) only understand basic AI concepts (e.g., Williams, 2018; Lin et al., 
2020). For example, Williams (2018) found that children understand 
three basic AI concepts: knowledge-based systems, supervised machine 
learning, generative AI. Furthermore, Kewalramani et al. (2021) applied 
a design-based research (DBR) approach to refine the instructional de-
signs through planning, scaffolding, building children’s inquiry skills, 
teacher-child and peer-peer interactions, and assessment/review of 
children’s learning for developing children’s inquiry. This approach is

appropriate for “small-scale educational research projects involving 
collaboration among educators, students, and researchers” (p. 56) to 
enable teachers to improve their instructional design to best foster stu-
dents’ AI literacy (Jetnikoff, 2015). 
Fourthly, three assessment methods were adopted to assess chil-
dren’s AI literacy in ECE, including knowledge and theory of mind skills 
assessments (4 articles), questionnaires (3 articles), and observation (3 
articles). We suggest further studies adopt performance-based mea-
surements for evaluating children’s AI knowledge/skills. Moreover, so 
far there has been no standard questionnaire, survey or test for assessing 
young children’s AI knowledge/skills. 
Finally, the current research on AI literacy in ECE classrooms lacks 
empirical research from implementation and research methods not very 
rigorous. More empirical and interventional research designs are ex-
pected to be implemented by researchers in future, with clearly defined 
curriculum and control groups and a variety of data analysis techniques 
(e.g., t-tests, ANOVA). 
Although included studies have discussed the positive cognitive 
learning gain that these learning programs could offer students, some 
studies stated several obstacles when students learn AI. For instance, low 
socioeconomic status (SES) children perform on average worse on AI 
abilities than children with higher SES backgrounds (Druga et al., 2019). 
This situation also happens in AI literacy education. A study investi-
gating whether SES will impact children’s AI perception shows that AI 
perception could be influenced by parents’ social-economical back-
ground. The authors also found that “children in low and medium SES 
schools and centres tend to have stronger collaboration skills compared 
to high SES children, but had a harder time advancing because they had 
less experience with coding and interacting with these technologies” 
(Druga et al., 2019, p. 1). 
6.1. Challenges and opportunities of AI literacy in early childhood 
education 
Challenges 
Current situation of using AI in early childhood education. In early 
childhood education, more young children use AI technologies such as 
evaluation systems, educational robots, chatbots were incorporated to 
enable teachers and parents to facilitate students’ cognitive and social 
development (Jin, 2019; Lin et al., 2020). These tools can help 
increasingly be used to automate grading, interact with children and 
feedback activities. We can see that AI has become virtual teachers, 
learning companions and caretakers to provide cognitive and social 
support for young children. However, young children who are the end 
users of these tools may not know the technologies behind. They may 
have misconceptions about AI concepts and do not know the limitations 
and impacts behind. 
Therefore, this review contributes to examine how to develop young 
children’s AI literacy through instructional design and tools, and 
assessment methods. We also investigate how these learning programs 
enhance young children’s learning outcomes in ECE settings. On top of 
these elements, the next section outlines the challenges and opportu-
nities of AI literacy in early childhood education (Table 10). 
Lack of teachers’ AI knowledge and skills. Teacher AI knowledge, in 
particular, was discovered to be one of the challenges encountered by 
educators who do not have technical background, but need to develop 
and implement early AI literacy curriculum in their schools. It is a 
challenge for most teachers. However, universities started to offer a 
wide range of AI activities for students such as the AI-for-kids curriculum 
in Hong Kong, and developed professional training for ECE teachers. 
They can make use of the resources to develop an age-appropriate cur-
riculum and activities for their students (Laato et al., 2020). Future 
studies should explore what types of learning activities and tools are 
more suitable for early childhood education, and what kind of teacher 
training is necessary for kindergarteners. 
Low teachers’ confidence. Since most ECE teachers do not have a 
technical background and have not yet received related training, they 
tend to have a low confidence level to understand AI, and a negative 
attitude to develop related activities and curriculum for their students. 
Educators reported feeling overwhelmed by the entire process of 
experimenting with new digital tools (Dickey, 2011; Horton & Horton, 
2003) and having little patience for dealing with minor technical issues 
(Davidson, 2012; Drexler et al., 2008; Perry, 2015). This is worsened by 
teachers’ tight teaching schedule and they do not have any extra time to 
learn AI knowledge. They may worry excessively since most of the 
currently available AI tools are children’s toys designed for children to 
explore what AI is (Dyrbye et al., 2009). As such, teachers’ unreadiness 
towards AI teaching is a great barrier for developing appropriate AI 
materials and activities. However, some university and company may 
help develop some AI materials (Ng et al., 2023). 
Lack of curriculum design. Few articles explain what, why, how, and 
when children should learn. Less research on early AI education, though, 
has concentrated on curriculum design (Su & Yang, 2022). Therefore, 
curriculum design is the second of the challenges encountered by edu-
cators when engaging in the development and implementation of early 
AI literacy. 
Lack of teaching guidelines. Experiential exposure and project-based 
learning is appropriate for children’s development of AI concepts 
(Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Williams, 2018; Williams et al., 2019). Among 
these activities, most of the studies have identified that children scaffold 
their understandings through age-appropriate AI tools (e.g., Williams, 
2018; Williams et al., 2019); however, not all kindergartens have the

resources for children. Therefore, governments’ support is important to 
sponsoring schools to equip them with these technologies to enrich 
students’ exposures. Further, some websites (e.g., Machine learning for 
kids https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/ and IBM https://www.ibm. 
org/activities/machine-learning-for-kids) 
offer 
open-source 
pre-
school-oriented AI curriculum using free web-based software such as 
Teachable Machine for young children to learn AI (Machine learning for 
kids, n.d.; IBM.org, n.d.). 
Opportunities 
Developing AI concepts and practices. In the past, it was challenging 
to foster young children to learn AI concepts and skills due to a lack of 
suitable tools. With a growing number of developmentally well-designed 
technologies for young children, young children can explore what AI is 
through playful experiences. For example, young children can play with 
AI social robots, toys and services (e.g., Cozmo, Pop Bots, Quickdraw, 
Wowee) to learn how to interact with AI tools that make responses based 
on children’s emotions and expressions and stimulate their curiosity to 
explore AI technologies in their everyday lives (Kewalramani et al., 
2021; Mc Stay & Rosner, 2021). The interaction with AI can help stu-
dents improve their digital literacy skills and attitudes, preparing them 
better for their progression in primary schools even though it is 
acknowledged that young children at this age hardly know and under-
stand AI. Parents could use these AI toys and services to create a digital 
environment for their kids, and this new skill may make them more 
comfortable with the tool, increasing the likelihood that they will use it 
in the future as part of their instructional design. For example, paren-
t–child interactions through AI toys (i.e., Alpha Mini, Coji, Qobo the 
snail, Lego Boost Bot) activities to enhance children’s social and 
emotional abilities (Kewalramani et al., 2021). 
Developing AI perspectives. AI perspectives refers to attitudes and 
dispositions adopted while solving problems (Ng et al., 2021). Most 
studies show that teaching young children early AI concepts and skills 
significantly enhances their understanding of AI (e.g., Rule-based sys-
tems, Supervised machine learning, and generative AI) (Williams, 2018; 
Williams et al., 2019). However, children may not comprehend the 
knowledge and concepts behind AI at a young age because AI in ECE is 
vastly different from AI in primary and secondary schools. For example, 
AI in ECE mainly focuses on how to use AI tools (i.e., AI toys) to facilitate 
their daily life and studies, but AI in primary and secondary schools 
focuses on knowledge and skills acquisition. However, young children 
can develop their digital skills through play and exploration, enhancing 
their emotional, collaborative, and inquiry literacy as well as related AI 
perspectives like social skills (like how to play and interact with other 
kids), curiosity, and others (Kewalramani et al., 2021). Children use AI 
devices (e.g., drawing tools, robotic toys, chatbots) on a daily basis to 
improve communication skills through group activities and stimulate 
their imagination through digital storytelling and writing (Ng et al., 
2022c). Based on the above, it is worth developing AI literacy for chil-
dren in ECE. The following demonstrates a summary of AI concepts, 
practices and perspectives adapted from Ng et al. (2021b), as shown in 
Table 11. 
6.2. Suggestions 
To address teaching challenges, educators should update their AI 
knowledge. Early childhood educators can use digital resources to learn 
AI concepts in their spare time.  
● Researchers should design adaptable AI curriculum approaches, such 
as holistic approaches. The six important components (i.e., AI 
knowledge, AI processes, the impact of AI (content and product), 
student relevance, teacher-student communication, and flexibility 
(process and praxis) for designing AI curriculum using holistic 
method (Chiu, 2021).  
● Educators should design more interesting AI activities for young 
children, which could change their existing attitudes towards AI.  
● A technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) 
framework should be taken into consideration to provide a roadmap 
for understanding how to effectively integrate AI literacy into 
classrooms in order to aid educators in teaching more effectively (Ng 
et al., 2022b).  
● Future researchers and educators will develop quantitative and 
qualitative assessments to assess children’s learning outcome 
through pre and post-knowledge tests, surveys, and observations. 
6.3. Pedagogical implications 
In order to help young children develop AI literacy skills at an ECE 
level, this paper first introduces various teaching content, tools, and 
pedagogy that are appropriate for this age group. This can aid in the 
development of age-appropriate AI curriculum, games, and toys for kids 
by researchers and educators (Ng & Chu, 2021). This article synthesises 
the evidence that shows the effectiveness of the AI curriculum in ECE. 
Most studies have shown that the AI curricula have significantly 
improved children’s AI or machine learning concepts (Williams et al., 
2019a,b; Ng et al., 2022a) and theory of mind skills and several inquiries 
(i.e., creative inquiry, emotional inquiry and collaborative inquiry). One 
study designed AI activities to enhance kindergarten children’s creative 
inquiry, emotional inquiry and collaborative inquiry (Kewalramani 
et al., 2021). Moreover, teachers were able to effectively implement the 
AI curricula in order to promote children’s learning and gains. For 
example, researchers could design interesting AI activities (e.g., interact 
with AI robots) for children to enhance children’s AI perceptions 
(Tazume et al., 2020). Furthermore, by presenting the various assess-
ment methods used, the research findings in this paper advance AI ed-
ucation in ECE research. Three frequent assessment tools were most 
used, including knowledge and skill assessments, observation, and 
questionnaires. For example, Williams (2018) used knowledge assess-
ments to examine children’s AI knowledge and skills. Results show that 
the AI curriculum for ECE has significantly improved children’s 
perceived AI knowledge. Therefore, there is a need to promote quality AI 
education in the early years at the fronts of pedagogical. 
This paper also outlines the challenges and opportunities of AI lit-
eracy in early childhood education for researchers and educators as a 
reference. The challenges of AI literacy in ECE, including lack of 
teachers’ AI knowledge and skills, low teachers’ confidence, lack of 
curriculum design, and lack of teaching guidelines. On the other hand, 
we identified some opportunities for AI literacy in ECE, including 
developing AI concepts and practices and AI perspectives. This paper 
provides some suggestions for researchers and educators. For example, 
future educators could design some engaging AI activities for young 
children’s learning about AI, such as interacting with AI robots, etc. Our 
discussion provides a good starting point for scholars to further inves-
tigate the effectiveness of early AI literacy and for various stakeholders 
to develop stimulating and engaging AI courses in educational fields.

7. Conclusion 
This review contributes to mapping the research design, tools, 
research methods, intervention programs, and research findings 
ascribed to the existing studies on early AI curriculum. It also explains 
the challenges and opportunities of AI literacy in early childhood edu-
cation. The results of this literature survey can inform future research in 
terms of advancing tools, pedagogical methods, research design, 
research methods, intervention, and assessment for early AI curricula 
and provide researchers and practitioners a guide for the design, 
implementation, and evaluation of age-appropriate AI curricula for 
young children. This review would provide valuable directions for early 
AI education and serve as a reference for future ECE research in the 
digital society. 
Two limitations in this study. Firstly, most of the studies selected in 
this review only are of their beginning stage and their research methods 
were preliminary, descriptive and exploratory in nature. More re-
searchers are anticipated to join the conversation, contributing more 
rigorous research techniques, as well as successful instructional and 
research designs for AI in ECE settings. Secondly, The research’s scope 
was constrained by the paucity of literature on AI literacy for early 
childhood education, making it impossible to quantify generalisations. 
However, according to the available literature, early AI literacy is a 
worthwhile investigation and a highly valuable emerging research di-
rection for future researchers.
