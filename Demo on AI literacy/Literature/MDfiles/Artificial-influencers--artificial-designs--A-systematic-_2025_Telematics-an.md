With the rapid evolutions in AI technology, a new type of influencer has emerged in the social 
media landscape – virtual influencers (VIs). These digitally created individuals have proven 
highly effective in promoting products, brands, opinions, and behaviors. So far, research has 
already shed light on the unique characteristics and effects of VIs. However, we lack a systematic 
discussion about experimental designs, which is a key design to understand the effectiveness of 
VIs. In a preregistered systematic review of N = 157 experiments, we examine how such studies 
are designed, the effects they measure, and the main moderating and mediating variables 
involved. Most studies test disclosure effects rather than the core persuasive features of virtual 
influencers, raising concerns about ecological validity. We discuss methodological implications 
and suggest directions for more ecologically valid experimental designs.
1. Introduction
Social media serve as primary platforms for information exchange and social interactions, with social media influencers (SMIs) 
playing a significant role (Hudders et al., 2021). SMIs can attain a large audience base through distinctive self-presentations (Djafarova 
and Trofimenko, 2019). They produce engaging content focused on specific products or niches, like health, lifestyle, or food (Hudders 
et al., 2021) and connect with their audience by sharing personal aspects of their lives, fostering a sense of familiarity (Kaˇnkov´a et al., 
2024). These elements enable them to influence their followers’ opinions and behaviors (see (Kaˇnkov´a et al., 2024). Recognizing their 
persuasive appeal, they have become important endorsers for brands and organizations (Hudders et al., 2021).
Recently, a new type of influencer has emerged, known as virtual influencers (VIs) (Yan et al., 2024). VIs are digital entities created 
through computer-generated imagery, machine learning algorithms and AI technology, who share their own personal content on social 
media (Sands et al., 2022). They have become increasingly popular, particularly among Gen Z users (Statista, 2022). For instance, the 
VI Lil Miquela has over 2.4 million followers on Instagram, and has already collaborated with major brands like Samsung and Prada. 
Like human influencers, VIs can effectively promote products and brands (Byun and Ahn, 2023) and influence their followers’ atti-
tudes, perceptions and behaviors (Kim et al., 2025; Lee and Shen, 2025).
Given the growing popularity of VIs on social media (Statista, 2022) and the accumulating body of research on this topic (Kim et al., 
2025), it is crucial to synthesize existing findings to gain a more fine-grained understanding. To our knowledge, three systematic

reviews have focused on the impact of VIs (Byun and Ahn, 2023; Hewapathirana and Perera, 2024; Laszkiewicz and Kalinska-Kula, 
2023), demonstrating their effectiveness in areas such as advertising. While all these studies shed light on the characteristics and 
effects of VIs, we lack a systematic discussion about experimental research designs. Experiments provide a key design to understand the 
effectiveness of VIs because – unlike survey research – they allow causal conclusions.
But are current experimental designs actually capturing the processes through which VIs exert a persuasive influence? The key 
challenge for the study of VIs is that they may not be recognizable as being artificial in a given experimental setting. This confronts 
experimental scholars with a serious dilemma: Scholars may use ‘real’ VIs, but these may not be recognized as being virtual, and 
consequently, the effects may not differ as compared to human influencers. Alternatively, scholars may tell respondents that influ-
encers are virtual (through disclosures), perhaps by using an actual VI or a human influencer labelled as being virtual. However, as has 
been noted (Binder et al., 2022), such studies may examine the effects of disclosure, not the actual AI-ness of a phenomenon. In other 
words, to understand the specific persuasive mechanisms through which VIs exert their influence, we must closely examine the specific 
experimental manipulations and designs.
We present a scoping review summarizing and discussing experimental research on VIs. We examine key methodological char-
acteristics such as the test design, sample, and the specific characteristics of the manipulation. To put these aspects into perspective, we 
also map the dependent, moderating, and mediating variables and summarize the main findings. Taken together, this study allows 
conclusions about whether the experimental designs used to study VIs are ecologically valid or artificially simplified, missing the full 
context in which real-world persuasion unfolds for VIs.
1.1. Persuasion by virtual influencers
VIs can broadly be defined as “artificial media personas […] characterized by a computer-generated face, which may either be 
connected to a digital body or superimposed on a real human body.” (Stein et al., 2022) (p. 3434). There are different categories of VIs, 
depending on their physical appearance and level of anthropomorphism (Yan et al., 2024). VIs can range from highly realistic, human- 
like figures that are nearly indistinguishable from real people (i.e., mimic-human VIs), to more stylized, cartoon-like figures with 
simplified human features (i.e., animated humanlike VIs), or even non-human forms such as objects or animals (i.e., non-human VIs) 
(Yan et al., 2024).
The impact of VIs has been widely studied in advertising and marketing contexts (Byun and Ahn, 2023; Kim et al., 2025) and health 
communication (Gupta et al., 2021; Winterstein et al., 2025). Recently, studies also investigated their effectiveness for environmental 
communication and political and social standpoints (Hong et al., 2024). All in all, these studies demonstrated that VIs can effectively 
influence attitudes, opinions, purchase intentions, and behavioral change.
What makes VIs so appealing to brands and organizations is their high controllability and customizability, allowing to tailor the 
VIs’ appearance and content to the audience (Sands et al., 2022). Also, unlike human influencers, they are less prone to scandals 
(Thomas and Fowler, 2021). One of the factors that explains the effectiveness, particularly for mimic-human VIs, is the perception of 
anthropomorphism – being perceived as human-like. Such perceptions are enhanced through realistic appearances, personal stories, 
and audience interactions (Stein et al., 2022). These traits help foster parasocial relations, in which followers develop one-sided 
emotional connections and increased trust (Lim and Lee, 2023; Ma and Li, 2024). However, VIs may not always be effective. They 
may be deemed too realistic and human-like, leading to resistance and negative evaluations (Yan et al., 2024; Arsenyan and Mirowska, 
2021), posing threats to credibility (Byun and Ahn, 2023).
So far, only three systematic reviews have focused on the persuasive impact of VIs (Byun and Ahn, 2023; Hewapathirana and 
Perera, 2024; Laszkiewicz and Kalinska-Kula, 2023). All three reviews indicate that audiences are generally receptive to recom-
mendations from VIs. They also indicated that VIs employ specific techniques to build trust, including sincere communication, 
emphasizing physical attractiveness, storytelling, and aligning content with the brand’s purpose and image (Hewapathirana and 
Perera, 2024). These techniques enable VIs to elicit similar reactions as human influencers in terms of advertising outcomes and PSRs 
(Byun and Ahn, 2023). From a brand perspective, the three reviews highlight several key advantages of VIs, including controllability, 
customizability, cost-efficiency, and innovation (Byun and Ahn, 2023; Hewapathirana and Perera, 2024; Laszkiewicz and Kalinska- 
Kula, 2023).
However, these reviews also highlight the potential disadvantages of VIs. One primary challenge is authenticity and trust (Byun and 
Ahn, 2023; Hewapathirana and Perera, 2024). Beyond these concerns, one review also raised ethical issues, such as responsibility and 
accountability, the need for transparency in VI usage, and the necessity of protecting vulnerable audiences from exposure to idealized 
VIs (Hewapathirana and Perera, 2024). When investigating VIs, these systematic reviews showcase that more research is needed to 
explore the different factors shaping advertising outcomes and how VI disclosures could influence them (Hewapathirana and Perera, 
2024). Furthermore, the reviews suggest that message elements (Byun and Ahn, 2023), platform differences, and distinctions among 
VIs should be considered (Laszkiewicz and Kalinska-Kula, 2023).
Despite the important knowledge obtained from these reviews, three specific limitations exist. First, these reviews included 
literature that relied on various quantitative and qualitative methods. Hence, no systematic review has focused on experimental 
research only, which is a key method to establish causal relationships. However, experimental research on VIs may also be particularly 
challenging. The core idea of an experiment is that an independent variable can be clearly identified and described. Yet the notion of 
VIs is particularly fuzzy: Some are clearly recognizable as virtual, while others (i.e., human-like VIs) are not. This raises the question of 
how the virtuality of an influencer can be translated into an experimental design. Also, the psychological mechanisms behind VI effects 
may rely on a relationship between human and non-human personae, which is hard to model in an experiment. Experiments may use 
simple designs that strip away the triggers decisive of VI persuasion. Thus, a close look at experimental studies is essential and overdue.

Second, the previous systematic reviews have not explored the full scope of VIs. They all solely focus on advertising studies, thereby 
overlooking the broader application of VIs across multiple domains (Sands et al., 2022; Hong et al., 2024). A focus on brand 
communication appears narrow. Third, previous systematic reviews have included studies from 2012 to 2023 (Byun and Ahn, 2023; 
Laszkiewicz and Kalinska-Kula, 2023), but the field is growing rapidly. That is, technologies used to create VIs are constantly being 
updated, leading to VIs that are even more realistic. This could potentially influence the impact of VI content. Hence, a more up-to-date 
review is necessary.
2. Research questions
Scholars need to conceptualize and operationally define a VI in any given experiment. Arguably, VIs are fundamentally different 
from human influencers: they are available online 24/7, can tailor their communication precisely to the audience’s preferences, and, 
most importantly, they occupy a unique space between fiction and reality (Thomas and Fowler, 2021). This ambiguity means users 
may treat them as real, even when aware of their artificial nature (Park et al., 2021). Furthermore, because VI outputs can be fully 
controlled (Byun and Ahn, 2023), their behavior is inherently more predictable than that of humans, whose actions can never be 
anticipated completely.
Users may recognize that they are interacting with a VI in two primary ways. First, VIs may be disclosed as such – they may 
introduce themselves as being computer-generated, or specific labels (e.g., “This is a virtual influencer”) and hashtags (e.g., #CGI; 
#virtualinfluencer) might be used. Second, users may infer artificiality from the VI’s distinctive verbal and nonverbal cues. For 
instance, VIs such as Lil Miquela are somehow visually flawless; they look more ‘perfect’ than a real person, almost uncanny (Arsenyan 
and Mirowska, 2021). Disclosure and stylistic signals are likely to shape users’ reactions to VIs (Lim and Lee, 2023). Yet, the question of 
whether individuals can recognize a VI is far from trivial, especially given the increasing sophistication of VIs. Indeed, users often 
cannot recognize the artificial nature of VIs (Hofeditz et al., 2022).
Based on this, we theorize that a critical distinction exists between three conditions: (1) when VIs are explicitly disclosed as such, 
(2) when users independently recognize their artificial nature, and (3) when the VI’s nature goes entirely unnoticed (Lim and Lee, 
2023; Mirowska and Arsenyan, 2023). In each case, the psychological and persuasive effects of VIs are likely to differ, particularly as 
perceived human-likeness tends to decrease when disclosure is present (Lim and Lee, 2023). Translated into experimental research 
logic, researchers need to make a critical design decision: whether to disclose to participants that they are interacting with a VI. 
Disclosures are commonly used to ensure that respondents recognize the artificiality of the VI (Lim and Lee, 2023). The advantage of 
this approach is that it allows the experimenter to clearly isolate the independent variable – knowledge of the influencer’s virtual 
nature – through random assignment. Yet this is, at the same time, precisely the disadvantage of disclosure, as such design tests the 
effect of knowing an influencer is virtual, compared to believing the influencer is human. As a result, the effects of the specific and unique 
verbal, visual, and communication-related characteristics of VIs cannot be tested with this design. These features are effectively held 
constant across conditions. This limitation is particularly pronounced in experimental designs that use real humans while merely 
labeling them as virtual (You and Liu, 2024).
By contrast, when experimenters employ an existing VI without disclosure, the design comes close to a real-world scenario in which 
virtuality is typically not disclosed or remains non-salient (Mertens et al., 2024). This approach allows for the observation of re-
spondents’ natural reactions, as they are not primed to think about the fact that an influencer is not a real person. In fact, in natural 
settings, it is conceivable that respondents are aware that an influencer is virtual, but this knowledge is not salient. Rephrased, re-
spondents may forget or disregard the virtuality of an influencer. The key advantage of this design lies in its ecological validity; that is, 
we can observe natural reactions as they occur in real interactions with VIs. The key disadvantage, however, may lie in reduced 
experimental control. In fact, participants may differ with respect to the question of whether they can recognize an influencer’s 
virtuality. This could introduce a potential unmeasured variable. Some respondents may be aware, others not, and the factors behind 
this awareness cannot be controlled for in the experiment. Moreover, for any experimental comparison, a real VI – certainly high in 
ecological validity – may have a myriad of unique characteristics driving experimental effects. Consequently, when there is a difference 
between experimental conditions, we may be unable to determine which specific characteristic of the VI is responsible for the effect. 
Thus, this design may be high in ecological validity, but threats to internal validity may exist, unless explicitly addressed.
Taken together, it becomes apparent that these design decisions crucially matter for research on VIs. On top of that, it is important 
to know what specific types of VIs are investigated in experimental research (i.e., mimic-human, animated human, or non-human VIs; 
see (Yan et al., 2024). Finally, the specific research domains (e.g., health, advertising, politics) inform us about the scope of research on 
VIs. Based on this, we ask:
RQ1: What are the key characteristics of VIs studied in experimental research?
Going beyond insights into how prior experiments operationalized VIs, it is also critical to shed light on more overarching 
methodological characteristics. This includes characteristics of the study setting, sample, stimulus materials, the specific platforms 
examined, and the measurement procedures employed. A comprehensive understanding of these factors is essential for evaluating the 
methodological depth and validity and enabling a more nuanced contextualization and interpretation of findings from these studies. 
These perspectives facilitate theorizing about methods and formulating avenues for future research. Therefore, we post the following 
research question:
RQ2: What are the methodological characteristics of experimental research on the persuasive impact of VIs?
Given the rapid advancements in AI technology and the increasing number of studies on this topic, we need a more up-to-date 
overview of the specific outcomes being studied. While much of the existing literature focuses on advertising (Byun and Ahn, 
2023), this study acknowledges that VIs are also employed in other contexts, such as health or environmental communication, or to

echo social and political opinions (Igarashi et al., 2024). Expanding the view across different contexts provides a more comprehensive 
understanding of the wide variety of outcomes that could be influenced. As we narrow our focus to experiments, a key question is not 
only whether VIs influence cognitions but also whether these influences translate into real-life actions and behaviors. To address this, 
we propose the following research question:
RQ3: Which persuasive outcomes are most frequently studied in experiments on VIs?
The impact of VIs on persuasive outcomes is complex, as it is driven by underlying processes explaining why VIs exert an impact (i. 
e., mediators) and may depend on individual differences that determine susceptibility to VIs (i.e., moderators). This idea is central to 
the Differential Susceptibility to Media Effects Model (DSMM) (Valkenburg and Peter, 2013). The DSMM proposes that three media 
response states explain the relation between media use and behavioral outcomes. These response states − cognitive (i.e., attention and 
comprehension), emotional (i.e., affective reactions), and excitative (i.e., psychological arousal) − occur during media exposure. 
Beyond these immediate responses, media effects themselves can also act as mediators, triggering additional outcomes that extend 
beyond the initial exposure (i.e., mediating media effects or second-order media effects).
In addition to these mediators, the DSMM suggests that media effects depend on dispositional, developmental, and social factors 
(Valkenburg and Peter, 2013). Dispositional factors include all variables that relate to personal dimensions (e.g., personality, values, 
beliefs, emotions, socio-demographics), developmental factors refer to variables that have to do with social, cognitive, and emotional 
developments, and social factors include social-context levels that operate at the interpersonal (e.g., family, friends), institutional (e.g., 
schools), and societal level (e.g., societal norms). Insights into the mediating and moderating factors enable us to unravel the 
complexity of VIs’ impact and help to identify factors or combinations of factors that merit deeper consideration in future research.
RQ4: What mediating and moderating factors are explored in experimental research on the persuasive impact of VIs?
Finally, this study will conclude by summarizing the key findings of research on the impact of VIs on different persuasive outcomes. 
By including recent literature and narrowing the focus to experimental studies, this study is among the first to provide insights into the 
specific causal impact of exposure to VIs’ content. This specific analysis serves as a guide for developing future research.
RQ5: What are the primary findings of experimental research on the persuasive impact of VIs?
3. Method
For this systematic review, we followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) (Page et al., 2021). The study was preregistered via the Open Science Framework (OSF).
3.1. Literature identification and screening
We conducted a systematic search via Scopus and Web of Science Science (Wo S), the two most extensive databases containing 
scholarly articles (Pranckut˙e, 2021). We used the following keywords to retrieve relevant articles across both databases: “virtual 
influencer*” OR “digital influencer*” OR “AI influencer*” OR “computer-generated influencer*” OR “CGI influencer*”.2 The asterisk 
(*) in the search command allowed for variations of these terms to be captured, ensuring a comprehensive search (see Table 1). At least 
one specified keyword had to be present in the title, abstract, or keywords. The search was conducted on November 29, 2024, and 
yielded n = 597 records. These records were exported and processed in Microsoft Excel. Before screening, duplicate records (n = 247) 
were removed.
A total of n = 350 records were screened according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) studies focusing on any type of virtual, 
digital, or AI social media influencers; (2) published in English; (3) peer-reviewed academic journal articles; and (4) studies using 
experimental designs. During this phase, the titles and abstracts of the studies were screened to assess their eligibility, leading to the 
exclusion of n = 272 records. Next, n = 77 reports were read by two coders, which led to the subsequent exclusion of n = 8 papers due 
to ineligible methodology and the lack of explicit focus on VIs. Altogether, n = 68 records were analyzed. One more study was excluded 
due to ineligible methodology. The process of identification and screening is depicted in the PRISMA Flow Diagram (see Fig. 1).
3.2. Coding and analysis
The coding process included both quantitative and qualitative codes. A comprehensive overview of the codebook and instructions 
is available via OSF. The codes were derived from the research questions and existing literature on human and virtual social media 
influencers (Kaˇnkov´a et al., 2024; Yan et al., 2024). We employed an inductive approach to define most coding categories, starting by 
screening titles and abstracts of included records to generate a preliminary list. However, additional categories emerged during the 
coding phase, particularly concerning the country of study and specific research topics. Consequently, we refined the codebook and 
recoded all records to ensure alignment with these updates. For the quantitative categories, coders selected the appropriate option 
from a list of predefined codes. For qualitative categories, coders were instructed to input relevant text snippets verbatim. Two coders 
were trained and independently coded a randomly selected subsample of n = 14 records (20.6 % of the total sample). Inter-coder 
reliability was assessed using Krippendorff’s α. Reliability was deemed sufficient (i.e., α ≥ 0.80; see (Sun, 2017) for 16 of the 23 
2 Initially, the search string included the keyword “experiment*” to specifically identify experimental studies. However, this keyword was sub-
sequently removed, as it became clear that not all experimental studies on this topic explicitly mentioned the methodology in the abstract, title, or 
keywords. Retaining this keyword could have inadvertently excluded potentially eligible studies, thereby limiting the final sample.

categories. For the remaining categories, coders thoroughly discussed discrepancies. As deviations were primarily due to differing 
interpretations of the codebook, the coding instructions were refined further. For instance, for the category Student sample, it was 
clarified that the codes “no” and “unspecified” should be grouped together to prevent overlap. After clarification, the coders conducted 
a second coding round, focusing only on the categories with prior disagreements. This second round yielded sufficient reliability (α ≥
0.80) for all remaining categories, thus validating the final codebook. For results on reliability coding, see Table 2. The same two 
coders who performed the reliability checks subsequently coded the entire sample. Coders had the option to flag papers where coding 
decisions were unclear and were also able to include notes on specific coding choices. Any flagged papers or notes triggered further 
discussions between the coders to reach a consensus. After completing this process, the coders descriptively analyzed the results. 
Additionally, one of the coders conducted the qualitative analysis. The final sample consisted of 68 records; however, as individual 
papers often included multiple experimental studies, the total number of coded experiments was N = 157 (M = 2.31 experimental 
studies per paper). The dataset is available via OSF.
4. Results
The list of studies included in this review is available via OSF. The studies were published between 2021 and 2025. There were 
some single studies published in 2021 and 2022 (both n = 1, 0.6 %), followed by a large increase in 2023 (n = 13; 19.1 %); and a peak in 
2024 (n = 48; 70.06 %). While we sampled studies in November 2024, some studies transitioned from advanced publications to full 
publications during the coding in 2025 (n = 5; 3.2 %). When reported, we coded the country of data collection. Most studies were 
conducted among samples from China (n = 40; 25.5 %) and the USA (n = 35; 22.3 %), followed by the UK (n = 7, 4.5 %). While there 
were individual studies focusing on other regions (e.g., Germany, Japan), China and the USA accounted for 81.52 % of the studies.
4.1. Quantitative results
The quantitative findings are depicted in Tables 3–5. To investigate RQ1, we investigated how VIs were depicted and which topics 
were being discussed. Most noteworthy, our findings highlight that most studies feature disclosures in which the nature of the VIs is 
explicitly revealed via introductory texts (n = 127; 80.9 %). These disclosures were predominantly presented before or during exposure 
to VIs (n = 111; 89.5 %). Most of these studies employed explicit disclosures, providing detailed explanations of what VIs are and how 
they are created (n = 73; 58.9 %), as opposed to more subtle disclosures that only acknowledge the presence of VIs (n = 49; 39.5 %).
Furthermore, we investigated the appearance of VIs. Our findings suggest that nearly half of the experiments (n = 77; 49.0 %) 
featured fictitious VIs. In 35.7 % of the experiments, real VIs (n = 56) were embedded. In these studies, scholars mostly relied on 
recognizable figures such as Lil Miquela, Ima, and Shudu. Where specified, we also coded the physical appearance of the VIs. While 
there are different types of VIs varying in the extent to which they mimic human features (e.g., Yan et al., 2024), approximately half of 
the studies depicted a VI that had a humanlike appearance (e.g., Lil Miquela; n = 80; 51.0 %), followed by an animated appearance (e. 
g., Noonouri; n = 21; 13.4 %). To investigate the impact of VIs on persuasion outcomes, studies tended to compare the VIs against

most of these studies contrasting an animated human VI with a mimic-human VI (n = 23; 71.19 %) (for an overview see Table 5).
Table 5 provides a comprehensive overview of experimental studies that compared (1) VIs to human SMIs, and (2) different types of 
VIs, categorized by VI type (existing vs. fictitious) and the presence or absence of VI origin disclosure. It illustrates that among studies 
comparing VIs to humans (n = 97), the majority disclosed the artificial nature of the VI (n = 76; 78.35 %). When disclosure was 
present, researchers more frequently used fictitious VIs (n = 52; 53.61 %) than existing ones (n = 24; 24.74 %). Similarly, studies

Note. The categorization of VIs based on typology by Yan et al. (2024). “Mimic-human” VIs are 
designed to closely resemble real humans, including existing VIs with highly realistic features (e. 
g., Lil Miquela) or real individuals presented as VIs with minimal digital alteration. “Animated- 
human” VIs are human-like but clearly stylized or digitally altered, often created with cartoon- 
like aesthetics, exaggerated features, or noticeable CGI or filter effects. “Non-human” VIs do not 
resemble humans and instead take the form of animals, robots, fantasy creatures, or other 
fictional entities. For a detailed explanation of the coding scheme, please refer to the codebook 
in the Online Appendix.

Note. “Existing VI” refers to stimuli featuring real, already-established VIs, whereas “Fictitious VI” denotes non-existing VIs created specifically for the 
study (e.g., by applying a filter to a human face). “Mixed VI types” refers to studies where both existing and fictitious VIs were used in the stimulus 
material.
“Disclosure present” means that participants were informed that the VI featured in the stimuli was not a real person, while “No disclosure” refers to 
instances where this information was withheld until debriefing. “Mixed disclosure” refers to studies in which disclosure was part of the experimental 
manipulation, i.e., some participants received a disclosure while others did not. For more details about the categorization, see the codebook in the 
Online Appendix. Eight experimental studies compared VIs with human SMIs but did not specify the type of VI used; these were coded as “Un-
specified.” Of these, six included a disclosure condition, and two used mixed disclosure conditions.

comparing different types of VIs (n = 32; 20.4 %) most again disclosed the VI’s artificial nature (n = 20; 62.5 %). Among these, eight 
studies used existing VIs, while fictitious and mixed approaches (i.e., using both existing and fictitious VIs) each appeared six times.
We also explored which specific topics they discussed. Most of the experimental studies focused on advertising and marketing (n =
114; 72.6 %). Various topics like fashion (n = 31, 19.7 %) and tourism (n = 25, 15.9 %) were discussed. Other topics were envi-
ronmental communication (n = 17; 10.8 %), food (n = 14; 8.9 %), and, to a lesser extent, technology (n = 11, 7.0 %), beauty (n = 8; 5.1 
%) and health (n = 8; 5.1 %).
RQ2 dealt with general methodological characteristics (see Table 1). Almost all experiments were conducted online (n = 153; 97.5 
%). Hence, field (n = 3; 1.9 %) and lab experiments (n = 1; 0.6 %) were barely present. Furthermore, the majority of studies assessed 
the causal effects using between-subject designs (n = 145; 92.4 %), whereas only 5.1 % of the studies (n = 8) used a mixed design, and 
2.5 % used a within-design (n = 4). As for the sample, it should be noted that many studies did not report the age range of participants, 
making it impossible to determine this information for 65.0 % of the experiments (n = 102). Among the remaining studies, student 
samples were present in only 5.7 % (n = 9), and participants under the age of 18 appeared in just 1.9 % (n = 3). In terms of stimuli, 
studies most frequently depicted materials from Instagram, with 42.0 % focusing on this platform (n = 66). Additionally, 7.0 % of the 
experiments presented content from Weibo and Red (both n = 11), while 3.2 % showcased content from X (formerly Twitter) (n = 5). 
You Tube, Facebook, and Twitch were less commonly studied platforms. The stimulus materials were predominantly static, with most 
studies incorporating visual content accompanied by text (n = 132; 84.1 %). Visual-only content was present in 6.4 % of the studies (n 
= 10), while textual-only content in 4.5 % (n = 7). Thus, more complex stimulus materials, including audiovisual content, were rarely 
used (n = 4; 2.5 %). Furthermore, almost all studies except for one relied on a single exposure treatment (n = 156; 99.4 %).
4.2. Qualitative results
RQ3 explored persuasion outcomes in experimental research on VIs. The findings showed a focus on cognitions and evaluations 
rather than changes in real-life behaviors. Overall, these studies broadly explored three types of outcomes. One branch of research 
examined engagement-related outcomes, particularly those tied to word-of-mouth, such as willingness and intention to share, like or 
comment on a VI’s posts; and the intentions to follow VIs (Sands et al., 2022; Lee and Lim, 2024). Another focus was on source, brand, 
and message evaluations. These studies explored attitudes (Ozdemir et al., 2023; Mo and Zhou, 2024) and credibility-related outcomes 
such as trust, expertise, attractiveness, and authenticity (Mirowska and Arsenyan, 2023; Park and Sung, 2023). Furthermore, these 
studies also examined emotional connections, including PSRs, emotional attachment and identification with VIs (Stein et al., 2022), 
and perceptions of AI-ness such as anthropomorphism or sensory capacities (Muniz et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024). A final category of 
outcomes focused on behavioral intentions, including purchase intentions (Thomas and Fowler, 2021; Song et al., 2024) or intentions 
to engage in pro-social behaviors such as blood donation (Igarashi et al., 2024). Actual behaviors were thus rarely studied, with ex-
ceptions including research on VIs’ effects on appearance-related anxiety (Deng and Jiang, 2023), and digital activism (You and Liu, 
2024).
RQ4 investigated the mediating and moderating factors in experimental research. A wide variety of mediating factors were 
identified, many of which were the same factors examined as outcomes in RQ3 but studied here as intermediaries. The mediating 
factors largely focused on second-order media effects, specifically evaluations and emotional connections, rather than real-time media 
response states, as outlined in the DSMM (Valkenburg and Peter, 2013). The evaluations fell into different categories: source credibility 
evaluations such as competence, trust, or expertise (Yang et al., 2023); brand/ VIs’ evaluations including brand congruency, product- 
endorser fit, and authenticity (Liu and Lee, 2024; Zhang et al., 2025), as well as perceptions of AI-ness, encompassing factors like 
eeriness, cuteness, novelty, anthropomorphism (Ham et al., 2024; Yoo et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024). Some studies examined more affect- 
based psychological connections and identifications with VIs, such as emotional trust, PSRs, psychological distance, and wishful 
identification (Lim and Lee, 2023). Notably, cognitive (e.g., attention), affective (e.g., empathy), or excitatory response states were 
largely absent. Only one study measured emotional arousal (Song et al., 2024).
As for the moderators, studies relied on a wide variety of factors, without a unified framework. In line with the DSMM (Valkenburg 
and Peter, 2013), only dispositional and social factors were considered, albeit sparsely. For dispositional factors, socio-demographics 
like gender (Mo and Wang, 2025) and personality traits, including the need for uniqueness, were investigated (Sands et al., 2022). For 
social factors, the cultural setting was taken into account (Franke and Groeppel-Klein, 2024). Developmental factors were not 
investigated. Beyond the factors outlined in the DSMM, moderators mostly refer to content elements such as specific style of messages, 
warmth, depiction modality, inclusion of social cues, sponsorship disclosures, and brand affiliations (Lim and Lee, 2023; Igarashi et al., 
2024). Other moderators included influencer characteristics such as the type of influencers, both in comparison to human influencers 
and among different VIs (Deng and Jiang, 2023). Finally, perceptions were also considered as moderators, such as novelty, eeriness, or 
anthropomorphism (You and Liu, 2024; Yoo et al., 2024).
The experimental findings (RQ5) highlight the complexity of VIs’ persuasive influence, shaped by the type of influencer, disclosure 
of their artificial nature, the message, and individual susceptibility factors. When comparing VIs to human influencers, key differences 
emerged. Research showed that, while audiences are receptive to VI content (Kim et al., 2025), they also perceive them to be less 
authentic, trustworthy (You and Liu, 2024; Yang et al., 2023), and capable in sensory experiences (Zhou et al., 2024). This led to less 
favorable attitudes towards the VIs, as well as lower purchase intentions (Mo and Zhou, 2024). Even when VIs were seen as successful 
endorsers, audiences did not attribute their success to them (Liu and Lee, 2024). At the same time, VIs were considered novel and 
unique, enhancing advertising outcomes (Volles et al., 2024). This demonstrates a double-edged sword whereby the lack of authen-
ticity negatively influences outcomes, whilst perceptions of novelty have a positive impact (Kim et al., 2025).
Beyond differences between VIs and humans, variations existed among VIs themselves. More humanlike VIs were perceived as

more credible (Park and Sung, 2023), trustworthy, and authentic, and individuals felt less distant from them (Franke and Groeppel- 
Klein, 2024). These factors positively influenced engagement, attitudes and intentions (Park and Sung, 2023). However, when VIs 
became too lifelike, they risked triggering the ‘uncanny valley’ effect, which reduced effectiveness (Gutuleac et al., 2024). Another 
crucial factor was whether a VIs’ artificial nature was disclosed. Research suggested that revealing VIs’ artificiality lowers perceptions 
of humanness or anthropomorphism (Lim and Lee, 2023; Muniz et al., 2024), credibility (Kim et al., 2025) and trust, thereby damaging 
engagement and persuasive appeal (Lee and Lim, 2024).
Furthermore, effectiveness depended on the type of message and product. Elements like social cues, and narratives that evoke 
emotions enhanced VI’s persuasiveness (Mo and Zhou, 2024; Li et al., 2024). VIs tended to be more effective when promoting 
adventurous (Wang et al., 2024) and utilitarian products (Belanche et al., 2019). Finally, individual differences played a role in how 
audiences respond to VIs. For example, Asian cultures, being more familiar with VIs, felt less distant from them (Franke and Groeppel- 
Klein, 2024). Other factors that increased effectiveness include prior familiarity and identification with VIs (Sakuma et al., 2023) and 
the need for uniqueness (Sands et al., 2022).
5. Discussion
The aim of this preregistered scoping review was to map recent experimental research on VIs. We started with the argument that VIs 
may be notoriously difficult to implement in an ecologically and internally valid experimental design. We were interested in how the 
virtual nature of a VI was conceptualized, whether ‘real’ VIs were used or whether disclosures were employed. Also, we aimed to shed 
light on the topics of study, basic methodological characteristics, outcomes, moderators and mediators, and the main findings.
By and large, our findings suggested that current experimental designs are limited to capturing the persuasive nature of VIs. We find 
that most experiments employ disclosures and work with humanlike VIs, mostly fictitious ones, who are typically compared to human 
influencers. Experiments mostly focused on marketing with Instagram as a dominant platform, employing static, text-accompanied 
visuals as stimuli. Persuasion outcomes focused on engagement, evaluations, and behavioral intentions, rarely measuring real be-
haviors. Mediators included perceptions of trust, authenticity, and anthropomorphism, while moderators ranged from message style to 
cultural factors. A key substantial finding is that VIs aid persuasion, but perceived artificiality may undermine effectiveness. In what 
follows, we summarize these points and translate them into concrete calls for action.
5.1. Going beyond AI disclosures
Most studies on VIs rely on explicit disclosures, informing participants about the virtual nature of influencers. While this approach 
isolates the effect of awareness of VIs’ artificiality on persuasive outcomes, often showing reduced persuasive power (Lim and Lee, 
2023; Mirowska and Arsenyan, 2023), it overlook how users naturally engage with VIs whose artificiality is not salient. In reality, most 
VIs do not disclose their non-autonomous nature (Lim and Lee, 2023; Mertens et al., 2024). For instance, Lil Miquela’s creators waited 
two years to reveal her identity (Hsu and Influencers, 2019). This gap highlights the need for more experimental research that omits 
disclosures and instead examines how users respond to VIs when their artificiality is not disclosed. Such work can explore how source 
(e.g., emotional expressiveness, interactivity, attractiveness), content characteristics (e.g., narratives, product types, frames), and their 
interplay shape trust, emotional bonding, persuasion, as well as which elements lead user to infer VIs’ artificial nature.
This, however, does not mean that we should abandon research on disclosures. Rather, it addresses distinct questions about how 
awareness of VIs’ artificiality affects trust, emotional engagement, and persuasion. However, there is ample room to expand this work 
in meaningful ways. For instance, users often continue to engage with VIs despite knowing they are artificial (Lou et al., 2023). Future 
qualitative and experimental research could explore the psychological mechanisms, such as escapism, and characteristics related to VIs 
(e.g., positivity, perfection, emotional responsiveness) that sustain engagement. Another research avenue relates to the ethical and 
protective role of disclosures. It has been argued that it is essential for average consumers to recognize that VIs are not real people 
(Mertens et al., 2024). This concern is particularly relevant for young and vulnerable audiences, such as adolescents, who may be more 
susceptible to VIs’ idealized and misleading portrayals (Hewapathirana and Perera, 2024). In this context, disclosures can function not 
only as transparency tools, but also protective mechanisms aimed at fostering critical reflection. Future research could explore how 
such disclosures can be designed and framed to elicit critical responses, thereby moving from simple disclosures (e.g., ‘this is a virtual 
influencer’) toward meaningful, media-literacy enhancing formats.
5.2. Going beyond single-exposure designs with fictitious VIs
A recurring methodological dilemma in influencer studies concerns whether to use real, existing SMIs or fictitious ones as each 
approach has its advantages and limitations (Harff et al., 2022). Existing SMIs may elicit stronger psychological engagement due to 
pre-existing PSRs, but they also introduce various potential confounds, such as participants’ varying levels of familiarity. In contrast, 
fictitious SMIs eliminate these confounds but typically lack the relational depth needed to elicit PSRs, which may compromise 
ecological validity (Harff et al., 2022).
As highlighted in this review, most experiments involving VIs employ single-exposure designs, most commonly using fictitious VIs. 
Therefore, alternative approaches are recommended. For instance, researchers could simulate real-world social media environments 
(Hendriks et al., 2021) in which participants could interact with fictitious VIs’ and their posts over a longer period of time. Repeated 
exposure to fictitious VIs in such designs could increase participants’ familiarity and facilitate the development of PSRs over time 
(Harff et al., 2022). Such designs unravel how people develop PSRs with VIs, and which source and content elements drive PSRs and 
S. Vranken et al.

other persuasive outcomes. The growing availability of AI-based tools, such as Midjourney, offers researchers the means to create 
highly realistic VI stimuli and to manipulate visual attributes such as the level of anthropomorphism. On the other hand, researchers 
could also implement real VIs in such designs to assess the true nature of VIs’ impact and to enhance the ecological validity of the 
designs.
While we provided some specific avenues for future research focusing on disclosures (absent or present) and the type of VI 
(fictitious or existing) separately, it is equally important to consider both aspects simultaneously when deciding which specific 
research question to examine, and how to develop the experimental design. Each design choice involves trade-offs between internal 
and ecological validity, experimental control and realism, as well as ethical transparency and naturalistic engagement. Therefore, we 
present a matrix (see Table 6) that outlines the key advantages and limitations of each design configuration, along with suggested 
research questions that align with their respective strengths. This framework aims to help scholars make strategic and transparent 
design decisions.
5.3. Going beyond single platform designs with static stimuli
Our findings showed that existing research mostly focused on a single platform, mainly Instagram, and a narrow range of content 
formats, typically static visual images. This limited scope reduces the generalizability of findings (Stoycheff et al., 2017; Vranken et al., 
2022). These studies overlook that VIs are active on multiple platforms like Tik Tok and You Tube, and utilize different content mo-
dalities including audiovisual messages such as Instagram Reels (Prajapat et al., 2025; Statista, 2025). Platform-specific characteristics 
and cross-platform modalities, however, may influence how VIs portray content, and the subsequent impact on their followers’ 
cognitions and behaviors (e.g., (Vranken et al., 2022; Voorveld et al., 2018). Audiovisual content modalities may foster more 
emotional engagement as it enables immersive and prolonged communication. Audiovisual content may also more clearly emphasize 
humanlike traits in VIs, like facial expressions. This could enhance perceptions of humanity (e.g., (Yu et al., 2024), which is crucial for 
VIs’ persuasiveness (Byun and Ahn, 2023; Yu et al., 2024). Apart from cross-content modalities, platform-specific features also play a 
role. For instance, Tik Tok’s emphasis on humor may further boost message effectiveness (Barta et al., 2023).
Although some studies have explored platform-specific and cross-platform modality differences in social media effects (Jaidka, 
2022; Vranken et al., 2024; Matassi and Boczkowski, 2021), systematic comparisons in the context of VIs impact remain scarce. We call 
for more comparative studies that examine how VIs adapt their content across platforms and modalities, and how these differences 
shape audience responses.
5.4. Going beyond advertising topics
Albeit not a methodological question, our study also reveals that most experiments focus primarily on advertising effects. This 
emphasis is understandable, given that VIs are typically created to serve as the ideal brand endorsers: their advertising content can be 
precisely tailored to meet marketing objectives (Byun and Ahn, 2023). However, considering the significant influence of VIs 
demonstrated by the studies reviewed, it is imperative that future research expands beyond advertising contexts.
Other important domains may include health or political communication. As for health, many VIs portray highly idealized life-
styles, featuring flawless appearances, ideal body shapes, vibrant social lives, and successful careers (Lee and Yuan, 2023; Small et al., 
2023), which could lead to negative emotions (e.g., envy, body image concerns) and could be detrimental for one’s overall well-being 
(Xia et al., 2025). However, VIs also create uplifting content, support prosocial causes, and offer companionship, which may positively 
influence well-being (Igarashi et al., 2024; Kim and Kim, 2025). As for political communication, there are reasons to assume that VIs 
share their opinions about politically and societal relevant topic (Hong et al., 2024). In the near future, they may even disseminate 
political information. Hence, future research should broaden the scope to other topical areas, and investigate a wider variety of

relevant outcomes. Expanding the scope to diverse areas also necessitates the use of domain-specific theories to understand the 
psychological processes driving VIs’ influence. As we move into new contexts, it is likely that other mechanisms will come into play. 
For instance, in the health domain, processes such as attitude formation, social norms, or internalization of ideals may be relevant to 
study.
5.5. Broadening the scope of mediating factors, moderating factors, and outcomes
Our study revealed that a mass of mediating and moderating factors were investigated, without a systematic theoretical framework. 
As for mediating factors, scholars mostly focused on source perceptions and behavioral cognitions. Following the DSMM Following 
(Valkenburg and Peter, 2013), research has largely neglected response states, including cognitive (e.g., attention), affective (e.g., 
emotions), and excitative states (e.g., arousal) that occur during exposure to VIs’. These internal states shape how media messages are 
processed, remembered, and how long the effects last (Valkenburg and Peter, 2013). One promising direction is to examine how 
anthropomorphic and humanlike cues, a central mechanism in VIs’ persuasion, affect these states. For instance, subtle humanlike 
features such as facial expressions may increase visual attention or emotional engagement. This could be empirically assessed with eye- 
tracking, and physiological measures such as heart rate and skin conductance. Moreover, affective response states deserve attention. 
Future research could investigate which specific emotions are elicited when exposed to VIs. Emotionally expressive VIs may evoke 
empathy, while other VIs may provoke discomfort, which could influence emotional bonds with and persuasiveness of VIs.
As for the moderating factors, there was barely any research focusing on dispositional, social, and developmental factors. As for 
dispositional factors, traditional ones commonly examined in media effects, including demographics and personality, should be 
supplemented with AI-specific dispositions. For example, individuals scoring high on AI literacy (Choung et al., 2022), and those who 
believe that machines are inferior as opposed to humans (i.e., machine heuristics) may be more skeptical about VIs’, and be less likely 
to be persuaded. Social factors including cross-cultural differences may be worth considering. For instance, individualistic cultures 
emphasize self-reliance and personal freedom, and may therefore be less open to emerging AI technologies and anthropomorphized 
agents (Rizzo et al., 2025). As for developmental factors, research that targets younger users and consider age-related susceptibility is 
lacking, thereby missing insights into a key vulnerable audience i.e., adolescents and emerging adults. They are heavy social media 
users and represent the primary audience of VIs (Statista, 2022). This group is sensitive to peer influence and immediate rewards, 
which could make them susceptible to VIs’ highly appealing and persuasive content.
Finally, when it comes to outcomes, most research focused on self-reported intentions and attitudes. While such measurements 
remain a common focus in SMI research (Kaˇnkov´a et al., 2024), it limits our understanding of how VIs influence tangible actions. We 
know that there is a clear gap between one’s intentions and their actual behaviors (Sheeran and Webb, 2016). Hence, future research 
should employ indicators of real behaviors such as discrete choice tasks whereby participants could choose between products pro-
moted by VIs.
6. Limitations
There are several limitations. As noted by Pham et al. (Pham et al., 2014), scoping reviews may be prone to bias in study selection, 
which can arise from the limited range of search terms. In our case, the deliberate decision to focus exclusively on experimental studies 
further narrowed the scope, potentially omitting valuable insights from other research designs. Additionally, the review was limited to 
English-language publications, which may have excluded pertinent findings published in other languages (Pham et al., 2014). This 
constraint is particularly relevant given that a substantial proportion of studies on the topic of VIs originates from Asian countries, 
where important research may be published in local languages and thus not captured in our analysis.
7. Conclusion
We conclude that VI research should reconsider its central methodological decisions. We call on researchers to overcome the simple 
dominance of disclosure-based, single-exposure, platform-limited designs with static, fictitious VI. Disclosure-based designs with 
fictitious VIs are certainly important, but they may be unable to capture the unique persuasive characteristics of VIs as well as the non- 
existing or ambiguous transparency of many ‘real’ VI profiles. While methodologically convenient, these studies may underestimate 
the true and dynamic persuasive power of existing VIs. Overcoming this dominance is possible. We outlined four different designs with 
specific advantages and disadvantages, and we exemplified some research questions best suited for each design (see Table 4). Also, and 
in line with this, to capture the full scope of persuasive effects, we recommend investigating the specific impact of differential dis-
closures of VIs, multiple platforms and cross-platform modalities, incorporating a larger set of response states as well as developmental 
and dispositional, developmental and social moderators. Also, behavioral outcome measures are urgently needed.
Given the vast and ongoing technological development, we believe that the study of VIs is at a critical turning point. Perpetuating 
the dominant experimental design could misrepresent user experiences, perceptions, and persuasive outcomes when dealing with VI. 
This has important consequences for our understanding of how VI impact brands, health behaviors, and society at large. Broadening 
the methodological scope of VI research will be essential in terms of academic rigor and ecological validity and inform policymaking, 
education, intervention (i.e., literacy programs), and future technological development.
