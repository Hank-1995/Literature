Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing, enhancing performance and productivity across various sectors, 
including higher education (HE), where it presents new opportunities to support student-centered learning. This 
study proposes a holistic AI-based framework to facilitate student-centered learning, developed through a 
qualitative and inductive methodology involving a systematic review of current literature. A large language 
model (LLM), Consensus. app, was employed as an academic search engine to identify the most relevant studies. 
Six search prompts, aligned with student-centered educational tasks identified through an inductive literature 
review, were developed and applied using established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Only studies published 
2020–2025 were considered. The retrieved studies were analyzed to identify key themes and derive AI-based 
components relevant to student-centered learning. These components were synthesized into a comprehensive 
framework consisting of six core elements. The significance of each component was evaluated through a qual-
itative comparison with traditional student-centered learning models, underscoring the potential impact and 
benefits of integrating the proposed AI-based framework in HE. The findings offer practical guidance for HE 
stakeholders seeking to implement AI-driven strategies to enhance student-centered learning.
1. Introduction
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into higher education 
(HE) practices is fundamentally reshaping traditional teaching and 
learning processes by enhancing efficiency, personalization, and scal-
ability, as AI-based technologies are increasingly adopted to automate 
assessments, enable predictive analytics, and streamline administrative 
operations (Axios & Colleges embrace chatbots, 2024; Chen et al., 2024; 
Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019a).
The evolution of AI in HE reflects a progressive shift from early 
Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) in the 1980s–1990s (Aderet-German 
& Dromi, 2021), which pioneered computer-assisted personalized 
learning. Foundational works such as (Gonzalez & Perez, 2020; Self 
et al., 1990; Wenger, 1988) established core principles for learner 
modelling, adaptive feedback, and domain-specific cognitive tutoring, 
laying the groundwork for subsequent developments in adaptive 
learning and analytics. This was followed by the integration of learning 
analytics in the early 2000s (Sawalhi & Chaaban, 2021) for tracking and 
predicting student performance. Seminal contribution (Siemens & 
Baker, 2012, pp. 252–254) formally established the field of learning 
analytics, bridging educational data mining with pedagogical practice, 
while (Ferguson, 2017) outlined critical adoption challenges and op-
portunities. Post-2010 developments saw the rise of adaptive learning 
platforms and AI-based content recommendation engines (Arnsby et al., 
2023; Holik & Sanda, 2020) that supported personalization at scale. 
Following 2020, the convergence of advanced Large Language Models 
(LLMs) with the post-pandemic digital transformation accelerated AI 
adoption in HE (Bond et al., 2024; S´anchez-Romero et al., 2019), setting 
the stage for integrated, student-centered AI frameworks.
Recent scholarship further underscores the importance of integrating 
affective, socio-emotional, governance, and foresight dimensions into 
AI-enhanced higher education. For example, Naseer et al. (Naseer, Khan, 
et al., 2024) explore deep learning for personalized learning pathways, 
while Tariq et al. (Tariq et al., 2025) review the state-of-the-art in 
computational thinking for STEM education. Addas et al. (Addas et al., 
2024) highlight governance innovations using telepresence robots and 
gamification, and Naseer et al. (Naseer, Khalid, et al., 2024) examine 
automated assessment and feedback mechanisms enabled by generative

AI. Complementing these, EDUCAUSE (EDUCAUSE, 2024) and OECD 
(Vincent-Lancrin & van der Vlies, 2024) provide authoritative foresight 
on the trends, challenges, and equity implications of AI in education at a 
global scale.
Recent scholarly reviews further contextualize this shift. Parker et al. 
(Parker et al., 2024) explore applications of LLMs in analyzing educa-
tional survey feedback, offering insights into their practical deployment 
in learning environments. Yan et al. (Yan et al., 2024) provide a sys-
tematic scoping review of the practical and ethical challenges of inte-
grating LLMs in education, while Belkina et al. (Belkina et al., 2025) 
synthesize case studies on implementing generative AI in higher edu-
cation, highlighting emerging best practices. Building on these layers, 
present LLM-based systems combine natural language understanding 
with adaptive analytics to deliver highly contextualized, interactive, and 
scalable student-centered learning experiences.
Despite the rapid expansion of novel AI applications, existing studies 
have primarily focused on the functional and technical dimensions of AI 
integration in HE, often overlooking its implications for learning. In 
particular, limited attention has been given to how AI technologies can 
align with and support student-centered learning, which emphasizes 
learner autonomy, personalized learning, collaboration, and educa-
tional equity. Most recent studies on AI in HE (Akinwalere & Ivanov, 
2022; Al Dhaen, 2022; Bearman et al., 2023; Bond et al., 2024; Holmes 
et al., 2021; Jafari & Keykha, 2024; Marengo et al., 2024; Matos et al., 
2025; Ouyang et al., 2022; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019b) predomi-
nantly examine AI’s operational capabilities, such as learning analytics 
and assessment automation, while offering minimal insight into prac-
tical pedagogical integration. Although some of these studies briefly 
mention potential educational implications, they do not provide a 
comprehensive analysis. For example, Holmes et al. discussed the 
broader educational impacts of AI; however, their analysis remains 
largely theoretical and does not address practical learning applications 
(Holmes et al., 2021). Similarly, Matos et al. concentrated on the 
administrative and infrastructural uses of AI in HE rather than on 
learning practices (Matos et al., 2025). In contrast, student-centered 
learning approaches prioritize addressing the diverse abilities, needs, 
and learning styles of individual learners, rejecting a one-size-fits-all 
model in favor of tailored learning experiences. According to Weimer 
(Weimer, 2013), student-centered learning places the responsibility of 
learning on students while positioning educators as facilitators who 
support personalized learning paths. This approach advocates for equity 
over equality, aiming to provide each learner with the specific support 
they need to succeed rather than offering identical support to all 
(Mc Combs, 2004). Recent research began exploring the application of AI 
technologies within student-centered learning environments, focusing 
on how AI can enhance personalized instruction, adaptive feedback, and 
collaborative learning experiences (Aderet-German & Dromi, 2021; 
Arnsby et al., 2023). These studies demonstrated promising results in 
using AI-based tools to support learner autonomy and to develop 
tailored educational pathways. However, most investigations remain 
fragmented, often addressing isolated aspects of student-centered 
learning such as adaptive feedback (Aderet-German & Dromi, 2021), 
personalization (Arnsby et al., 2023), or collaborative learning support 
(Holik & Sanda, 2020), without integrating these elements into a 
cohesive pedagogical framework. Moreover, many existing works 
emphasize technical development or proof-of-concept prototypes 
(Sawalhi & Chaaban, 2021), offering minimal systematic analysis of 
their learning efficacy or alignment with the core student-centered 
educational tasks that underpin effective student-centered learning in 
HE. This gap underscores the need for a comprehensive and structured 
synthesis of the literature that comprehensively maps AI interventions to 
the student-centered educational tasks that define student-centered 
learning in HE. To address these gaps, this study systematically maps 
AI-based learning components to core student-centered educational 
tasks and proposes the AI-based student-centered framework.
This study conducts a structured synthesis of the current literature 
with a specific focus on the relevance of learning. This review advances 
theory by consolidating fragmented literature into a cohesive frame-
work mapping AI-based components to six student-centered educational 
tasks. It advances practice by outlining concrete applications of these 
components in HE, enabling stakeholders, i.e. policy-makers, university 
leaders, curriculum designers, faculty, and technologists, to make 
informed, evidence-based implementation decisions. The present study 
makes the following key contributions: 
1. Through a systematic review of the literature supported by qualita-
tive, inductive analysis, six broad student-centered educational tasks 
are identified to support student-centered learning, reflecting urgent 
needs in light of rapid AI advancements and post-pandemic digital 
transformation in HE. These educational tasks inform the develop-
ment of a conceptual classification scheme for AI-based components 
that support student-centered learning, unlike previous works that 
considered the application of AI to specific educational tasks in a 
fragmented manner.
2. A comprehensive AI-based framework is synthesized, incorporating 
these classified components in an integrative manner to enhance 
student-centered learning in HE.
Valuable insights are offered for HE stakeholders into the importance 
of implementing the proposed AI-based student-centered learning 
framework, especially when compared with traditional student-centered 
learning approaches. This framework can inform policy decisions for 
policy-makers, strategic planning for university leaders, course and 
assessment design for curriculum designers and faculty, and AI so-
lution development for technologists, supporting practical integration 
into institutional processes and digital infrastructures.
Unlike previous works, which provided a fragmented analysis on the 
application of AI for specific learning objectives, this study proposes a 
holistic AI-based framework to facilitate student-centered learning, 
providing curriculum designers and faculty with foundational guidance 
to integrate AI tools across some key dimensions of the HE curricula. 
Specifically, this review provides an inductive thematic synthesis across 
six student-centered educational tasks and consequently proposes a 
holistic AI-based framework to facilitate student-centered learning, 
providing stakeholders with foundational guidance to integrate AI 
across some key dimensions of the HE.
By centering on the alignment between AI capabilities and student- 
centered educational tasks, this study presents a holistic and action-
able framework for advancing inclusive and responsive learning in HE. 
The proposed approach not only clarifies how AI can support diverse 
learner needs, but also offers practical guidance for integrating AI tools 
in ways that meaningfully enhance student-centered pedagogy.
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 outlines the 
methodology employed in this study. Section 3 provides an in-depth 
analysis of AI-based student-centered learning components in HE. 
Then, Section 4 discusses the key findings and their pedagogical impli-
cations. Finally, Section 5 concludes the study and offers directions for 
future research, while Section 6 introduces a dedicated ‘Future Di-
rections’ subsection that outlines emerging trends and strategic recom-
mendations for research and practice.
2. Methodology
2.1. Research aim and question
In recent years, the integration of AI in HE has opened new possi-
bilities for advancing student-centered learning. As HE institutions 
increasingly adopt AI tools, there is a growing need to understand how 
these technologies can be aligned with pedagogical goals to foster in-
clusive, responsive, and student-centered education. Despite the surge in 
AI adoption, a clear, comprehensive framework that maps AI capabil-
ities 
to 
student-centered 
educational 
tasks 
in 
HE 
remains

underdeveloped.
This study aims to address that gap by systematically reviewing and 
analyzing the most relevant recent literature to identify state-of-the-art 
AI-based student-centered learning framework and their foundational 
components. Given the heterogeneity in study designs, intervention 
types, and outcome measures, no statistical aggregation (e.g., meta- 
analysis) was conducted. A purely qualitative evidence synthesis was 
employed, following Thomas & Harden’s (Thomas & Harden, 2008) 
three-stage thematic synthesis to integrate diverse empirical and con-
ceptual evidence into a coherent framework.
Furthermore, this study evaluates how the foundational components 
contribute to and potentially enhance modern HE when compared to 
traditional student-centered approaches. Accordingly, the guiding 
research question for this study is: What are the emerging, compre-
hensive AI-based student-centered learning framework and their asso-
ciated components utilized in HE, and how do they significantly impact 
modern HE compared to traditional frameworks? To explore this ques-
tion, the study adopts a qualitative, inductive methodology using a 
systematic review of literature. The review specifically focuses on how 
AI-based learning tools and components are applied to student-centered 
educational tasks in HE.
The academic research engine Consensus. app was employed to 
facilitate the retrieval of peer-reviewed scientific literature. This tool 
uses advanced keyword and vector-based search, combined with meta-
data analysis, to identify the most relevant studies from a corpus of over 
200 million academic publications. The methodology for qualitative, 
inductive literature 100 review performed in this work is introduced 
next.
2.2. Sample size
A total of sixty studies were selected, with 10 studies chosen for each 
prompt-based theme. This number is justified because it represents a 
focused yet comprehensive sample of the most relevant and high-impact 
studies. This “10-per-theme” approach is consistent with qualitative 
evidence synthesis guidelines, where thematic saturation is typically 
achieved with 8–12 rich studies per theme (Booth et al., 2016; Thomas & 
Harden, 2008). The approach prioritizes conceptual depth and the 
identification of key components that emerge across studies, a corner-
stone characteristic of qualitative research (Thomas & Harden, 2008). 
By applying rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria and validating all 
article content manually, the selected sample ensures representativeness 
and quality of findings within each thematic area.
2.3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
To systematically identify and evaluate studies most relevant to the 
research objective, this review employed a clearly defined set of inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria. These criteria were designed to ensure that 
selected studies directly addressed AI-based student-centered learning 
within the context of HE and met appropriate standards of quality and 
recency. The inclusion 120 and exclusion criteria applied to this review 
are outlined below. Inclusion Criteria: Eligible studies were peer- 
reviewed journal articles published between 2020 and 2025, written 
in English, and situated within the fields of Business, Computer Science, 
Economics, Education, or Engineering. Only open-access publications 
appearing in Q1 journals1 were considered.
Additionally, included studies were required to explicitly address 
student-centered educational tasks. Exclusion Criteria: Studies were 
excluded if they duplicated results across search queries, lacked suffi-
cient methodological detail, or were available only as preprints. To 
minimize thematic overlap between prompt-based queries, any terms 
uniquely associated with a given prompt (excluding the prompt itself) 
were omitted from other searches. These excluded terms included: 
Tutoring, Customize, Interactive, Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, 
Assessment, and Curriculum Design. All included studies were retrieved 
using Consensus. app, an LLM-based academic search engine. To ensure 
methodological robustness, the relevance of each study to the research 
questions was manually validated to ensure contextual accuracy.
2.4. Conceptual framework
In the context of student-centered learning in HE, the educator’s role 
has expanded to include both teaching and mentorship responsibilities. 
This dual role is well-supported in the literature, which underscores the 
integration of mentoring and instruction across diverse educational 
contexts (Aderet-German & Dromi, 2021; Arnsby et al., 2023). Other 
studies further emphasize the importance of teacher leadership and the 
character strengths of mentor teachers in fostering effective student 
engagement and support (Holik & Sanda, 2020; Sawalhi & Chaaban, 
2021).
Through an inductive qualitative synthesis of recent literature, this 
study identifies six student-centered educational tasks central to 
student-centered learning: Tutoring, Customized Learning, Interactive 
Learning, Performance Monitoring, Assessment, and Curriculum Design. 
These tasks are grounded in empirical findings from multiple disciplines, 
including teacher education, nursing, computer science, and digital 
pedagogy (Abdigapbarova & Zhiyenbayeva, 2022; Berg & Lepp, 2023; 
Lee & Hannafin, 2016; Matiisen et al., 2017; Nanney, 2020; Zhang et al., 
2021). For example, tutoring and one-to-one interaction have been 
shown to enhance student outcomes in digital environments (Zhang 
et al., 2021), while customized and interactive learning are highlighted 
as key strategies in nursing and online education (Berg & Lepp, 2023; 
Nanney, 2020).
These six themes align with established pedagogical framework that 
prioritize active learning, personalized instruction, adaptive feedback, 
and continuous assessment as core principles of student-centered edu-
cation (Greener, 2015; S´anchez-Romero et al., 2019). Based on the 
identified student-centered educational tasks, six distinct prompt-based 
queries were formulated to identify relevant AI-driven components in 
HE. Each query corresponds to a specific educational theme: tutoring, 
customized learning, interactive learning, performance monitoring, 
assessment, and curriculum design. The themes and corresponding 
queries are given in Table 1.
The six prompt questions are inductively derived from preliminary 
scoping of the literature and mapped to established student-centered 
educational 
tasks 
identified 
in 
pedagogical 
frameworks 
(Abdigapbarova & Zhiyenbayeva, 2022; Aderet-German & Dromi, 2021; 
Arnsby et al., 2023; Berg & Lepp, 2023; Greener, 2015; Holik & Sanda, 
2020; Lee & Hannafin, 2016; Matiisen et al., 2017; Mc Combs, 2004; 
Nanney, 2020; S´anchez-Romero et al., 2019; Sawalhi & Chaaban, 2021; 
Thomas & Harden, 2008; Weimer, 2013; Zhang et al., 2021). An initial 
pilot search phase was conducted to refine query wording for thematic

precision, reduce overlap, and maximize retrieval relevance. No sepa-
rate exploratory study is conducted; instead, the pilot serves as a 
methodological calibration step.
The content validity of the prompt questions was ensured by aligning 
each query with empirically grounded constructs from the student- 
centered learning literature. In Consensus. app, The prompts were 
refined iteratively to enhance precision and reduce thematic overlap. 
The retrieved articles were subsequently reviewed by the author to 
verify contextual relevance prior to inclusion in the dataset.
Each of the six prompt-based search themes was executed in 
Consensus. app, which retrieves and ranks studies from most to least 
relevant based on semantic and contextual matching. The ten most 
relevant studies per theme were selected to ensure conceptual richness 
and thematic depth. Where a retrieved study was found to be ineligible, 
it was replaced by the next most relevant study in the ranked list to 
maintain the sample size. The AI-based ranking process reduced the 
need for multiple independent screeners, as the highest-ranked results 
required minimal exclusions, and relevance could be verified through an 
iterative screening process. The PRISMA flow diagram (Fig. 1) summa-
rizes this process.
To structure the investigation, this study groups the selected AI- 
based learning studies into six themes, each aligned with one of the 
student-centered educational tasks. This thematic grouping is applied to 
the development of AI-based student-centered learning components that 
conform the conceptual framework devised in this paper, as represented 
in Fig. 2. Note that component placeholders are used at this stage in the 
graphic representation of the conceptual framework in Fig. 2, with 
detailed descriptions provided later in Section IV.
Thematic analysis followed the three-stage inductive approach pro-
posed in (Thomas & Harden, 2008). In the first stage, relevant segments 
of text from each included study were assigned descriptive codes 
reflecting AI-based student-centered learning concepts. In the second 
stage, related codes were grouped into broader descriptive themes 
capturing shared meanings. In the final stage, these categories were 
synthesized into six overarching analytical themes aligned with the 
research aim. An iterative self-review and refinement process was fol-
lowed to ensure internal consistency. Academic rigor was maintained 
through transparent documentation of coding decisions, systematic 
re-examination of coded data, and validation of final themes against the 
original studies to confirm accuracy.
3. A literature-driven analysis of AI-based student-centered 
learning components in HE
Building on the inductive thematic analysis process described in 
Section 2.4, the final six themes emerged through iterative refinement, 
where provisional codes from included studies were aggregated into 
thematic clusters corresponding to the predefined student-centered 
educational tasks. Consistency of theme allocation was ensured 
through repeated review and validation against the original study con-
tent. This section presents a literature-based thematic analysis of the 
included academic studies, organized into six categories — each repre-
senting a core student-centered educational task — which collectively 
form the basis of the proposed framework.
3.1. Theme 1
The first prompt-based query is “AI-based student-centered tutoring 
in higher education”. Additional inclusion criteria for this theme is the 
appearance of the “tutoring” keyword in the title and/or the abstract of 
the related studies.
AI is increasingly enhancing tutoring in HE through a variety of 
applications and methodologies. For example (Hemachandran et al., 
2022), demonstrated that AI can improve tutoring accuracy up to 58 %, 
narrowing the gap between human lecturers and machine-based in-
struction by employing model development and comparison techniques. 
Similarly (Kim & Kim, 2020), introduced an AI tutoring tool for learning 
the Korean language that integrates three developmental learning net-
works, enabling personalized educational services through the same 
methodological approach.
Expanding on performance analytics (Prada et al., 2020), presented 
an AI-based tutoring capable of predicting engineering students’ aca-
demic outcomes and dropout risks, achieving accuracies as high as 90 % 
and supporting early intervention strategies in HE. A systematic review 
by (Paladines & Ramirez, 2020) further confirmed the effectiveness of 
intelligent tutoring, particularly those using natural language dialogue, 
in improving student understanding within science, technology, engi-
neering, and mathematics (STEM) domains by addressing mis-
conceptions and enhancing problem-solving skills.
The role of AI in student adaptation and skill development is also 
well documented (Chelnokova et al., 2020). emphasized that tutoring

technologies significantly contribute to successful student integration 
into HE environments by fostering sustainable learning skills. In the 
medical education context (Fazlollahi et al., 2022), showed that 
AI-based tutoring significantly outperforms both expert instruction and 
no feedback scenarios in developing students’ simulated surgical skills.
Similarly (Cerezo et al., 2020), found that intelligent tutoring pro-
motes self-regulated learning strategies, especially benefiting students 
with learning difficulties.
Other applications include the one proposed by (Mi, 2022), which 
presented a deep-learning-based hybrid model that effectively detects 
cheating in massive open online course (MOOC)s, thereby enhancing 
AI-supported English language tutoring. Beyond AI-based systems, 
peer-tutoring programs have also shown considerable promise; for 
instance (Tirado et al., 2020), reported substantial academic improve-
ment among first-year students at a Spanish university.
Additionally (Mackowski & Brzoza, 2022), introduced an accessible 
AI-based tutoring platform for visually impaired learners, leveraging 
audio-tactile graphics and adaptive audio descriptions to verify knowl-
edge and customize exercises, thereby increasing learning effectiveness. 
This group of studies highlights the potential of AI-based student-cen-
tered tutoring to enhance engagement, adaptability, and individualized 
learning, and reflect a growing trend toward more interactive and 
effective educational technologies.
Collectively, the studies in Theme 1 (Cerezo et al., 2020; Chelnokova 
et al., 2020; Fazlollahi et al., 2022; Hemachandran et al., 2022; Kim & 
Kim, 2020; Mackowski & Brzoza, 2022; Mi, 2022; Paladines & Ramirez, 
2020; Prada et al., 2020; Tirado et al., 2020) informed the identification 
of the first AI-based student-centered 220 learning component, which is 
referred to as AI-based Intelligent Tutoring.
3.2. Theme 2
In this theme, the prompt-based query is “AI-based student-centered 
customized learning in higher education” and the special inclusion 
criteria for this theme is the appearance of the following keywords in the 
title and abstract of the related studies: “personalization”, “custom-
ization”, and “privacy".
AI-based personalized learning has become increasingly significant 
in HE, offering tailored educational experiences based on individual 
learner needs.
For instance (Murtaza et al., 2022), concluded that such systems 
enhance learning by delivering content and assessments aligned with 
learners’ comprehension levels and preferred learning modalities. 
Building on this (Zhang et al., 2022), proposed a recommender system 
based on the Q-LRDP-D algorithm—an approach that combines Learning 
Resource Difficulty Prediction with Dijkstra’s algorithm based on a 
Q-matrix—to effectively recommend personalized learning resources, 
thereby improving efficiency and minimizing resource wastage.
The role of digital tools in HE was further examined by 
(Garcia-Martinez et al., 2020), which analyzed students’ usage patterns 
for accessing information, content creation, and interaction. The study 
found that, while accessing information is most common, content cre-
ation is relatively less frequent, suggesting a need for more balanced 
engagement. In support of learning environments (He & Wang, 2023), 
introduced an intelligent content distribution based on machine 
learning that customizes teaching content in accordance with resource 
constraints, thereby enhancing both personalization and educational 
modernization. Privacy-preserving personalization was addressed by 
(Xu & Yin, 2022), which develop a recommendation system utilizing 
machine learning and differential privacy, ensuring learner data confi-
dentiality while delivering customized educational experiences.
Similarly (Huang, 2022), applied deep learning techniques to 
personalized college English instruction, demonstrating that such 
methods reduce teacher workload while effectively catering to indi-
vidual student needs. Enhancements in educational video recommen-
dation were explored by (Liu, 2023a), where a model incorporating 
category, label, and semantic features was proposed to better align video 
content with student preferences. Mobile learning innovations were 
presented by (Huerta-Guerrero et al., 2021), which detailed the design 
of the Kaanbal platform—a mobile system that supports learning 
monitoring and personalization through analysis of learning styles, 
context, and mobile learning objects, ultimately strengthening teaching 
strategies.
To bridge the digital divide, particularly in under-resourced regions 
(Song et al., 2021), introduced the Mobile-Assisted Personalized 
Learning (MAPL) model. This model leverages full distance learning and 
the principles of personalized learn260 ing to improve access and equity 
in education across developing countries.
Lastly (Liu, 2023b), tackled the challenge of recommending 
interest-oriented learning resources by constructing a model based on 
Fig. 2. Conceptual framework.
H. Albasry et al.

the communicative power of highly rated materials, with experimental 
results confirming its effectiveness in personalized content delivery. In 
combination, this group of studies underscored the growing importance 
of student-centered customized learning in HE, showcasing how AI can 
address individual student needs and enrich learning experiences across 
diverse educational contexts.
Collectively, the studies in Theme 2 (Garcia-Martinez et al., 2020; 
He & Wang, 2023; Huang, 2022; Huerta-Guerrero et al., 2021; Liu, 
2023a, 2023b; Murtaza et al., 2022; Song et al., 2021; Xu & Yin, 2022; 
Zhang et al., 2022) inform the identification of the second AI-based 
student-centered educational component, which is referred to as 
AI-based Personalized Learning.
3.3. Theme 3
The prompt-based query for this theme is “AI-based student-centered 
interactive learning in higher education.” The special inclusion criteria 
for this theme is the inclusion of the following keyword in the title and 
abstract of the related studies: “interactive learning".
The studies in Theme 3 focus on the use of AI to foster interactive and 
immersive learning environments in HE. For instance (Neo et al., 2022), 
investigated the role of AI chatbots as scaffolding agents during stu-
dents’ independent online learning sessions, concluding that tools such 
as MERLIN enhance both motivation and learning outcomes, increasing 
students’ interest in their wider implementation. Similarly (de L´azaro & 
Duart, 2023), demonstrated that the integration of extended reality and 
AI technologies significantly enhances online HE by making it more 
accessible, effective, engaging, and adaptable to diverse learning 
trajectories.
In the domain of language learning (Katsarou et al., 2023), explored 
voice-based Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) and their potential to 
support English as a Foreign Language (EFL) acquisition, while (Zhang, 
2022) analyzed the design of interactive courses for international Chi-
nese language education using the cognitive heuristic model, which was 
showed to effectively stimulate learner interest and improve perfor-
mance (Dai et al., 2023). contributed to this field by proposing a smart 
classroom architecture based on a Multi-Screen Interactive Learning 
System (MSILS), which enhances student engagement and satisfaction, 
particularly in engineering education settings.
Further extending interactivity in physical classrooms (Hsieh et al., 
2020), presented a robot-assisted teaching framework grounded in the 
Attention, Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction (ARCS) motivation 
model, which fosters meaningful interaction between teachers, students, 
and robots, thereby improving students’ learning motivation and 
effectiveness.
In a similar vein (Abouhashem et al., 2021), introduced a distinctive 
interactive online STEM teaching model that maintains high student 
engagement and retention despite the limitations of virtual classrooms. 
The use of virtual reality (VR) was explored by (Mallek et al., 2024), 
which found that when VR applications are aligned with established 
educational theories—such as constructivism, experiential learning, and 
collaborative learning—they can provide personalized, immersive, and 
interactive learning experiences that significantly improve learning 
outcomes (Wang et al., 2022). examined AI mediated social interaction 
in online learning contexts, highlighting how AI agents like SAMI help 
reduce social isolation and support ethical engagement, though they 
must navigate challenges related to user agency and privacy.
Finally (Díaz, 2020), investigated virtual worlds as educational 
platforms and concluded that they support hybrid and mobile learning 
models by promoting inclusivity, participatory pedagogy, and improved 
access to information for both students and educators. Collectively, this 
group of studies highlights the significance of interactive learning sup-
port in HE, illustrating the potential of AI to enhance interactivity, 
engagement, and support within virtual learning environments. The 
studies in Theme 3 (Abouhashem et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2023; de L´azaro 
& Duart, 2023; Díaz, 2020; Hsieh et al., 2020; Katsarou et al., 2023; 
Mallek et al., 2024; Neo et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zhang, 2022) 
collectively lead to the identification of the third AI-based stu-
dent-centered educational component, which is referred to as AI-based 
Virtual Learning.
3.4. Theme 4
The prompt-based query for this theme is “AI-based student-centered 
performance monitoring in higher education”. The inclusion criterion 
for this theme is the inclusion of the “performance” keyword in the title 
and abstract of the related studies.
The studies in Theme 4 emphasize the use of AI for predictive ana-
lytics and early intervention in HE (Waheed et al., 2020). demonstrated 
that deep artificial neural networks can accurately identify at-risk stu-
dents in virtual learning environments, enabling timely intervention and 
informed educational decision making. Similarly (Jokhan et al., 2022), 
presented an AI-based analytics tool designed to predict student per-
formance in a first-year information technology literacy 330 course at 
the University of the South Pacific. The tool not only supported early 
intervention but also contributed to the realization of Sustainable 
Development Goal 4 (SDG4), which advocates for inclusive and equi-
table quality education.
In the context of engineering education (Bressane et al., 2022), 
introduced a fuzzy AI-based model that outperforms traditional AI 
methods in forecasting student performance and retention risk, 
achieving 94.0 % training accuracy and 91.9 % generalization accuracy. 
A comparable effort is seen by (Yousafzai et al., 2021), where an 
attention based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi LSTM) 
network was proposed to predict student performance from historical 
data, yielding a high 340 prediction accuracy of 90.16 %.
(Mahafdah et al., 2024a) confirmed the superiority of AI-based 
models in enhancing e-learning outcomes, showing that Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNNs) surpass other deep learning and machine 
learning techniques in predictive accuracy during student performance 
forecasting. Likewise (Ouatik et al., 2022), integrated big data tech-
nology with machine learning algorithms and reported that Support 
Vector Machines (SVM) achieved a recognition rate of 87.32 % in pre-
dicting academic success and failure.
The incorporation of real-time behavioral monitoring was demon-
strated by (Yao, 2022), which proposed a Differential Convolutional 
Neural Network (DCNN)-based facial expression recognition algorithm. 
This tool effectively monitored students’ classroom status and assists in 
balancing educational resources. In a similar vein (Deo et al., 2020), 
applied Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to predict performance in 
engineering mathematics courses, outperforming random forest and 
Volterra models with lower prediction errors. ELM showed strong per-
formance in both on-campus and online learning environments, offering 
valuable insights for improving teaching practices and addressing 
graduate outcomes.
Finally (Chen & Cui, 2020), utilized Long Short-Term Memory 
(LSTM) networks to analyze learning management system (LMS) data, 
focusing on early prediction of course performance through students’ 
online behavior. LSTM models demonstrated higher accuracy and 
generalizability compared to eight conventional machine learning 
classifiers, proving particularly effective in detecting at-risk students 
through time-series clickstream data.
Together, these studies underscore the potential of student perfor-
mance monitoring in HE, demonstrating how AI can forecast academic 
performance, identify trends, and strengthen measures, contributing to 
the improvement of learning outcomes. The studies in Theme 4 
(Bressane et al., 2022; Chen & Cui, 2020; Deo et al., 2020; Jokhan et al., 
2022; Mahafdah et al., 2024a, 2024b; Ouatik et al., 2022; Waheed et al., 
2020; Yao, 2022; Yousafzai et al., 2021) collectively lead to the identi-
fication of a new AI-based student-centered learning component, which 
is referred to it as AI-based Predictive Analytics.
H. Albasry et al.

3.5. Theme 5
The prompt-based query for this theme is “AI-based student-centered 
evaluation/assessment in higher education”, and the inclusion criterion 
for this theme is the appearance of the keywords “evaluation” and 
“assessment” in the title and abstract of the related studies.
The studies in Theme 5 focused on AI-enabled assessment and 
evaluation systems that enhance feedback mechanisms, automate 
grading, and support more personalized learning interventions in HE. 
For instance (Vittorini et al., 2020), introduced an AI-based system for 
auto-grading R-based assignments in MOOCs, which significantly 
reduced grading time and aligned well with human grading, while 
enhancing student performance and maintaining usability. Similarly 
(Guo et al., 2024), proposed a human-centered AI approach leveraging 
machine learning to analyze students’ test-taking processes in 
large-scale assessments. By integrating process and response data, this 
method provided detailed student profiles, offering deeper insights 
beyond test scores for more targeted educational interventions.
In the study by (Bagunaid et al., 2022), an AI-based system called 
Artificial Intelligence-based Student Assessment and Recommendation 
(AISAR) was developed, utilizing recurrent neural networks (RNNs), 
clustering, and reinforcement learning to assess performance and 
generate personalized learning recommendations. This system demon-
strated enhanced prediction accuracy and effective support for indi-
vidual learning paths. A case study by (Barra et al., 2020) explored an 
automated, student-centered tool for adapting programming course as-
sessments to an online format during COVID-19. The tool facilitated 
remote evaluation, received highly positive student feedback, and 
showed promise 395 for sustainable long-term use.
Moreover (Botaccio et al., 2020), presented a virtual evaluation 
platform designed to transition HE assessment from traditional methods 
to more student-centered and democratic practices. Developed using a 
design-based research model, this platform supported both educators 
and learners, aiming to improve overall educational quality. A 
comprehensive review by (Messer et al., 2023) of 121 studies on auto-
mated grading tools in programming education revealed a strong focus 
on correctness (e.g., via unit testing). Despite these limitations, auto-
mated assessments were shown to offer fast feedback and support iter-
ative learning, though challenges remain regarding dataset availability 
and tool comparability.
In addition (Osabutey et al., 2022), provided empirical evidence that 
well-designed 
online 
assessments 
can 
outperform 
traditional 
paper-based exams in enhancing academic performance. These findings 
offer practical guidance for policymaking and curriculum design. 
Complementarily (Ifenthaler et al., 2022), emphasized the role of 
self-assessment tools, showing that student engagement with 
self-assessments positively correlates with final exam performance. The 
study integrated self-reporting, learning analytics, and outcome data to 
offer a holistic view of the learning process (Zinn et al., 2020). supported 
the validity of unsupervised, web-based cognitive assessments, 
concluding that such methods are both viable and efficient alternatives 
for large-scale evaluation, despite some minor biases.
Lastly (Wang, 2022), introduced an improved K-means clustering 
algorithm aimed at refining student evaluations by accounting for 
course difficulty and student performance trends. The model showed 
faster clustering, better noise handling, and greater effectiveness in 
supporting instructional management. Collectively, these studies high-
light the significance of student-centered assessment and evaluation in 
HE, showcasing their potential to streamline grading processes and 
enhance student feedback. This, in turn, contributes to fostering more 
efficient and responsive educational practices.
The studies in Theme 5 (Bagunaid et al., 2022; Barra et al., 2020; 
Botaccio et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2024; Ifenthaler et al., 2022; Messer 
et al., 2023; Osabutey et al., 2022; Vittorini et al., 2020; Wang, 2022; 
Zinn et al., 2020) collectively lead to the identification of another 
AI-based student-centered educational component, which is referred to 
as AI-based Adaptive Assessment.
3.6. Theme 6
The prompt-based query for this theme is “AI-based tool for student- 
centered curriculum design in higher education”. The inclusion criterion 
for this theme is the appearance of the “curriculum design” keyword in 
the title and abstract. The studies in Theme 6 focus on AI-enabled Cur-
riculum Design and Educational Transformation, examining how arti-
ficial intelligence contributes to the development, evaluation, and 
adaptation of curricula across educational contexts. For example 
(Tolentino et al., 2024), reviewed AI education within medical training, 
revealing a lack of structured curricula and recommending a multidis-
ciplinary framework to integrate AI into medical education.
Similarly (Chiu & Chai, 2020), explored K–12 teachers’ perspectives 
on AI curriculum design, identifying the importance of incorporating 
four curriculum design approaches—content, product, process, and 
praxis—while emphasizing teacher motivation and proposing a sus-
tainable development cycle (Abid et al., 2023). presented a flexible 
one-month elective course that introduced AI and machine learning 
(ML) to fourth-year medical students. The course, built on web-based 
resources and project-based learning, enhanced student confidence in 
AI/ML concepts by 66 % and encouraged exploration of AI in medical 
specialties. The authors offered the course as a scalable model for AI 
integration in medical education. To address curriculum design in 
data-scarce environments (Mc Eneaney & Morsink, 2022), proposed 
Curriculum Modelling and Learner Simulation (CMLS), a simulation 
framework using evidence-based learning principles to predict student 
outcomes and inform data-driven curricular redesign.
Further contributing to inclusive computing education (Newton 
et al., 2023), introduced the Student-Centered Computing (SCC) cur-
riculum, integrating project based learning and culturally authentic 
pedagogies. While teacher interviews and surveys indicated positive 
engagement, the study also emphasized the need for pedagogical 
training to manage implementation challenges (Zuo & Wang, 2021). 
developed a deep learning-based curriculum evaluation system using 
autoencoders to assess HE curricula across 50 universities in Chongqing. 
This model identified key influencing factors and proposed a new 
classroom teaching model to address curriculum quality gaps.
(Khoza & Mpungose, 2020) examined the rapid digital trans-
formation of curricula during the COVID-19 pandemic at a South African 
HE institution. The study identified five transformation proc-
esses—reflection, translation, rotation, enlargement, and reduc-
tion—that reshaped academic practice and emphasized aligning 
curricula with sustainable digital values. In the context of radiology 
education (Lindqwister et al., 2020), introduced AI-RADS, an intro-
ductory AI curriculum for residents, which successfully increased con-
fidence and understanding of AI-related academic literature.
Focusing 
on 
student 
involvement 
in 
curriculum 
shaping 
(Lubicz-Nawrocka & Bovill, 2021), analyzed cocreated curricula 
through a multi-institutional study using Johansson and Felten’s trans-
formation framework. The results emphasized relationship building, 
academic risk-taking, and deeper engagement as outcomes of the 
co-creation process. In terms of fostering civic engagement and social 
justice (Atenas et al., 2020), advocated for integrating data literacy into 
HE curriculum design through critically oriented pedagogies. The study 
proposed the use of open data and problem-based learning to develop 
democratic competencies in a data-driven society.
Lastly (Srivastava et al., 2024), contributed to curriculum analytics 
by examining the relationship between elective course selection and 
student performance. Using sequential and temporal analysis, the study 
introduced new curriculum metrics and offered practical recommenda-
tions for academic advising, curriculum optimization, and institutional 
policy.
In summary, these works emphasize the role of student-centered 
curriculum design and development in HE, highlighting the potential

of AI to enhance learning by tailoring content and resources to meet 
students’ unique needs and preferences. The studies in Theme 6 (Abid 
et al., 2023; Atenas et al., 2020; Chiu & Chai, 2020; Khoza & Mpungose, 
2020; Lindqwister et al., 2020; Lubicz-Nawrocka & Bovill, 2021; Mc E-
neaney & Morsink, 2022; Newton et al., 2023; Srivastava et al., 2024; 
Tolentino et al., 2024; Zuo & Wang, 2021) inform the identification of 
an AI-based student-centered educational component, which is referred 
to as AI-based Content Recommendation.
4. A holistic AI-Based student-centered educational framework 
for higher education
In the previous section, six AI-based learning components were 
identified—Intelligent 
Tutoring, 
Personalized 
Learning, 
Virtual 
Learning, Predictive Analytics, Adaptive Assessment, and Content Rec-
ommendation—each aligned with a specific student-centered educa-
tional task. Appendix A
provides a concise summary of these 
components, aligned with their themes and supporting studies, com-
plementing the detailed discussion in Section 3 and allowing readers to 
easily trace each component to its evidence base.
Building on these, this section presents a comprehensive AI-based 
student-centered learning framework for HE. Each component plays a 
distinct role within the framework, as illustrated in Fig. 3, providing 
practical guidance for HE stakeholders aiming to implement AI-driven 
strategies that enhance student-centered learning. The significance 
and impact of each component are analyzed and compared with 
traditional HE frameworks to validate the proposed model. This analysis 
provides a theoretical foundation for the proposed framework, sup-
ported by empirical insights drawn from an inductive, qualitative review 
of the literature.
4.1. AI-based intelligent tutoring
Findings from Theme 1 highlight the advantages of AI-based Intel-
ligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) over traditional tutoring in higher edu-
cation. Conventional methods are often constrained by instructor 
availability, class size, and delayed, generalized feedback, whereas AI- 
based ITS deliver continuous, adaptive, and personalized instruction 
that dynamically responds to each student’s needs and pace (Blumberg 
& Michael, 2009; Chelnokova et al., 2020; Hemachandran et al., 2022; 
Kim & Kim, 2020; Paladines & Ramirez, 2020; Prada et al., 2020; 
Van Lehn, 2011). These systems identify knowledge gaps, provide im-
mediate feedback, and recommend targeted resources, thereby 
improving learning outcomes and engagement (Azevedo, 2013; Cerezo 
et al., 2020; Topping & Ehly, 2005).
ITS also foster metacognitive skills—planning, monitoring, and 
reflection—essential for student success (Azevedo, 2013; Cerezo et al., 
2020; Topping & Ehly, 2005). They offer scalability, enabling real-time 
monitoring and timely interventions (Mc Cready, 2020; Mi, 2022; Prada 
et al., 2020), and have demonstrated strong performance in high-stakes 
domains such as surgical training and STEM education (Cook & Triola, 
2013; Fazlollahi et al., 2022; Miller, 2018; Nye et al., 2014). 
Fig. 3. AI-based student-centered learning framework.
H. Albasry et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Social Sciences & Humanities Open 12 (2025) 102085 

--- Page 9 ---

Furthermore, they enhance inclusivity by supporting learners with dis-
abilities and diverse backgrounds through adaptive interfaces and 
multimodal content delivery (Alazawei & Mc Clymont, 2017; Mackowski 
& Brzoza, 2022; Seale, 2006). AI-driven peer tutoring models further 
extend these benefits, improving academic performance while offering 
consistent and adaptable support (Tirado et al., 2020; Topping & Ehly, 
2005).
In sum, AI-based tutoring marks a shift toward personalized, scal-
able, and data-driven educational practices. While traditional tutoring 
retains value, it often falls short in responsiveness, scalability, and 
inclusivity—areas where AI-based systems consistently excel (Alazawei 
& Mc Clymont, 2017; Azevedo, 2013; Blumberg & Michael, 2009; Cerezo 
et al., 2020; Chelnokova et al., 2020; Cook & Triola, 2013; Fazlollahi 
et al., 2022; Hemachandran et al., 2022; Kim & Kim, 2020; Mackowski & 
Brzoza, 2022; Mc Cready, 2020; Mi, 2022; Miller, 2018; Nye et al., 2014; 
Paladines & Ramirez, 2020; Prada et al., 2020; Seale, 2006; Tirado et al., 
2020; Topping & Ehly, 2005; Van Lehn, 2011).
4.2. AI-based personalized learning
Theme 2 findings show that AI-based personalized learning signifi-
cantly enhances higher education by tailoring content, assessments, and 
resources to individual learner needs, preferences, and progress rates 
(Garcia-Martinez et al., 2020; Murtaza et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022). 
These tools provide real-time recommendations, adaptive assessments, 
and early interventions through continuous tracking and predictive 
analytics (Murtaza et al., 2022; Xu & Yin, 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), in 
contrast to standardized curricula and infrequent assessments typical of 
traditional approaches.
By fostering self-regulated learning through goal-setting, moni-
toring, and targeted resources (He & Wang, 2023; Huang, 2022), AI 
supports sustained metacognitive engagement at scale. It also improves 
inclusivity via adaptive interfaces and multimodal delivery (text, video, 
audio) for diverse learners, including those with disabilities 
(Huerta-Guerrero et al., 2021; Xu & Yin, 2022), and addresses infra-
structural gaps in underserved regions through models such as 
Mobile-Assisted Personalized Learning (MAPL) (Song et al., 2021). 
Moreover, scalability enables individualized learning for large cohorts 
without overburdening educators (Liu, 2023b; Song et al., 2021), while 
dynamic resource allocation optimizes efficiency and minimizes 
redundancy (He & Wang, 2023; Zhang et al., 2022).
Overall, AI-based personalized learning creates adaptive, scalable, 
and inclusive environments that overcome the limitations of conven-
tional systems, enabling more responsive, equitable, and effective 
educational support.
4.3. AI-based virtual learning
Findings from Theme 3 (Abouhashem et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2023; de 
L´azaro & Duart, 2023; Díaz, 2020; Hsieh et al., 2020; Katsarou et al., 
2023; Mallek et al., 2024; Neo et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zhang, 
2022) show that AI-based virtual learning surpasses traditional systems 
in interactivity, adaptability, and engagement. Unlike static materials 
and limited real-time interaction in conventional models, AI tools—such 
as chatbots (Neo et al., 2022), extended reality (de L´azaro & Duart, 
2023), and intelligent virtual agents (Katsarou et al., 2023; Zhang, 
2022)—deliver adaptive, context-aware support tailored to individual 
pacing and needs.
These systems sustain motivation and participation through imme-
diate feedback, gamification, and immersive experiences (Dai et al., 
2023; de L´azaro & Duart, 2023; Hsieh et al., 2020; Neo et al., 2022), and 
accommodate diverse learning styles via multimodal delivery 
(Abouhashem et al., 2021; Katsarou et al., 2023; Mallek et al., 2024), 
whereas traditional methods often follow a uniform approach. They also 
scale effectively, providing personalized support to large cohorts 
(Abouhashem et al., 2021), and foster collaboration through 
AI-mediated interactions (Díaz, 2020; Wang et al., 2022), addressing 
isolation common in standard online models.
Moreover, AI-driven platforms enhance accessibility for remote and 
underserved learners (de L´azaro & Duart, 2023; Díaz, 2020; Mallek 
et al., 2024), achieving equity at a scale traditional infrastructures rarely 
match. Overall, they create interactive, scalable, and inclusive envi-
ronments aligned with student-centered education principles.
4.4. AI-based predictive analytics
Findings from Theme 4 show that AI-based predictive analytics en-
ables proactive, real-time monitoring of student performance, out-
performing traditional retrospective or periodic assessment methods. 
While conventional systems often identify issues only after final grades 
or delayed reviews, AI models detect early warning signals—such as 
reduced engagement or irregular submissions—allowing timely, 
tailored interventions (Bressane et al., 2022; Jokhan et al., 2022; 
Mahafdah et al., 2024b; Waheed et al., 2020; Yousafzai et al., 2021).
These tools also inform curriculum and instructional design by 
highlighting content areas linked to poor performance, enabling tar-
geted improvements (Chen & Cui, 2020; Mahafdah et al., 2024a; Ouatik 
et al., 2022). In contrast, traditional feedback methods (e.g., 
end-of-course surveys) lack the immediacy and depth required for rapid 
adjustments. Predictive analytics further supports institutional plan-
ning, forecasting trends, and optimizing resource allocation, while 
promoting equity by identifying disparities across learner groups (Deo 
et al., 2020; Yao, 2022).
Overall, AI-driven predictive analytics provides a scalable, precise, 
and adaptive framework for enhancing student outcomes and institu-
tional responsiveness, surpassing the limitations of conventional moni-
toring systems (Papamitsiou & Economides, 2014; Tsai & Gaˇsevi´c, 2020; 
Viberg & Gr¨onlund, 2018).
4.5. AI-based adaptive assessment
Findings from Theme 5 show that AI-based adaptive assessment 
tailors evaluation in real time to individual learner performance, 
adjusting question difficulty, pacing, and feedback. Unlike traditional 
standardized or fixed-format tests, which provide a static snapshot and 
generalized feedback (Messer et al., 2023; Osabutey et al., 2022; Pelle-
grino & Hilton, 2016), adaptive systems deliver targeted, data-driven 
insights that identify specific knowledge gaps (Bagunaid et al., 2022; 
Barra et al., 2020; Botaccio et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2024; Vittorini et al., 
2020).
These tools foster engagement by keeping tasks within an optimal 
challenge range, providing immediate, personalized feedback, and 
enabling continuous learning—capabilities often missing from conven-
tional assessments (Gibbons & Toppin, 2019; Shute & Zapata-Rivera, 
2015, pp. 107–124). Beyond individual benefits, adaptive platforms 
generate granular analytics at both student and cohort levels, allowing 
educators to refine instruction and address systemic gaps (Baker, 2010, 
pp. 195–204; Friedrich & Schuck, 2015; Gibbons & Toppin, 2019).
Overall, AI-based adaptive assessment enhances personalization, 
motivation, and instructional precision, offering a dynamic and 
responsive alternative to the static and delayed nature of traditional 
evaluation methods.
4.6. AI-based content recommendation
AI-based content recommendation enhances student-centered cur-
riculum design by tailoring learning materials to individual needs, 
preferences, and performance trends (Abid et al., 2023; Chiu & Chai, 
2020; Mc Eneaney & Morsink, 2022; Tolentino et al., 2024). Unlike 
traditional approaches, which rely on fixed, one-size-fits-all materials 
(Khoza & Mpungose, 2020), these systems dynamically adapt content in 
real time, bridging knowledge gaps and reinforcing understanding 
H. Albasry et al.

(Newton et al., 2023; Zuo & Wang, 2021).
They also support educators by aligning recommendations with 
specific learning objectives, enabling data-driven curriculum adjust-
ments (Gonzalez & Perez, 2020; Lindqwister et al., 2020; Xu et al., 
2018). This contrasts with conventional methods, where feedback and 
adaptation are slower and less targeted. Moreover, AI-powered tools 
facilitate inclusive, flexible, and scalable curriculum development 
(Atenas et al., 2020; Chiu & Chai, 2020; Khoza & Mpungose, 2020; 
Newton et al., 2023; Tolentino et al., 2024), incorporating learner 
co-creation (Lubicz-Nawrocka & Bovill, 2021) and socially engaged, 
data-literate pedagogies (Atenas et al., 2020).
Overall, AI-based content recommendation offers adaptive, respon-
sive, and evidence-based curriculum transformation, improving both 
learner engagement and instructional precision in ways traditional 
methods cannot match.
5. Conclusion
This study proposed a comprehensive AI-based student-centered 
learning framework for HE by systematically reviewing recent literature 
and identifying six core components: Intelligent Tutoring, Personalized 
Learning, Virtual Learning, Predictive Analytics, Adaptive Assessment, 
and Content Recommendation. These components were derived through 
inductive qualitative analysis and aligned with specific student-centered 
educational tasks. Each component was critically analyzed in compari-
son with traditional HE practices, demonstrating how AI-based tools not 
only address the limitations of conventional methods—such as scal-
ability, personalization, feedback latency, and inclusivity—but also 
offer transformative potential across learning delivery, student support, 
and institutional decision-making. The review revealed that AI can 
significantly enhance the responsiveness, accessibility, and effectiveness 
of student-centered education, marking a shift toward more adaptive, 
data-informed pedagogical environments. The framework delivers 
actionable value for multiple stakeholders: policy-makers can align na-
tional and institutional strategies with AI-based learning; university 
leaders can integrate it into strategic and resource planning; curriculum 
designers and faculty can embed AI-based tools into teaching and 
assessment; and technologists can use it to guide the design and 
deployment of tailored AI-based olutions. By integrating findings from 
recent, high-quality peer-reviewed studies, this work provides a timely, 
evidence-based roadmap for modernizing student-centered education in 
HE. Looking ahead, the Future Directions section identifies key tech-
nical, pedagogical, ethical, and regulatory priorities that will guide the 
evolution of AI-enhanced learning frameworks, ensuring they advance 
innovation while promoting equity, sustainability, and responsible 
implementation.
6. Future Directions
The rapid evolution of AI in HE requires forward-looking research to 
anticipate emerging technical, pedagogical, ethical, and regulatory 
trends. From a technical perspective, developments in multimodal AI, 
federated learning, and adaptive analytics are poised to advance 
personalized learning by enabling more nuanced learner modeling and 
real-time feedback (Bond et al., 2024; Holmes et al., 2021; 
S´anchez-Romero et al., 2019). Pedagogically, future frameworks should 
explore AI-driven formative assessment (Weimer, 2013), intelligent 
collaborative learning support (Aderet-German & Dromi, 2021), and 
context-aware instructional design (Mc Combs, 2004), ensuring inclu-
sivity and alignment with diverse learner needs.
Ethical considerations remain central, particularly regarding algo-
rithmic transparency, bias mitigation, and equitable access in AI- 
supported learning environments (Holik & Sanda, 2020; Sawalhi & 
Chaaban, 2021). Data privacy and security—especially under 
GDPR—will demand sustained attention, with frameworks ensuring that 
AI adoption in HE complies with national and institutional governance 
models (Abdigapbarova & Zhiyenbayeva, 2022; Matiisen et al., 2017).
These forward-looking perspectives are grounded in the progression 
from seminal innovations such as early Intelligent Tutoring Systems 
(Aderet-German & Dromi, 2021), through the adoption of learning an-
alytics (Sawalhi & Chaaban, 2021), to the integration of adaptive 
learning platforms and AI-based content recommendation engines 
(Arnsby et al., 2023; Holik & Sanda, 2020). The current wave, marked 
by LLM-powered systems (Bond et al., 2024; S´anchez-Romero et al., 
2019), represents a paradigm shift toward highly contextualized, 
interactive, and scalable student-centered learning, while retaining the 
foundational goal of personalization established in earlier eras.
Generative AI models such as LLMs are known to produce so-called 
hallucinations, i.e. outputs that are factually incorrect or misleading. 
These errors can be highly convincing, making them difficult for users to 
detect. These hallucinations pose significant challenges to education, 
raising concerns about misinformation, trust, and ethical use. Halluci-
nations often arise from biased or incomplete training data, ambiguous 
prompts, or model limitations. Therefore, it is argued that LLM evolution 
in the educational context should not only rely on technological evo-
lution, but also include topic experts and curriculum designers to foresee 
the accuracy and reliability of LLMs through human-in-the-loop mech-
anisms (Roychowdhury, 2023).
Hallucinations in student-centered learning AI frameworks are more 
likely to happen when used for the teaching of rapidly-evolving topics 
and novel knowledge, especially in postgraduate learning environments, 
due to the potentially lower availability of novel information in datasets 
used to train AI models (Mc Intosh et al., 2024). A key implication of this 
is that a differentiated integration of AI in HE might be required ac-
cording to factors such as educational level, background knowledge 
required, and so forth. In this context, human-in-the-loop mechanisms 
are of particular relevance and might require expert faculty to be 
involved in the training and evaluation of models.
Moreover, human judgment and cultural context can influence what 
is considered an hallucination, complicating detection and evaluation. 
Most current hallucination mitigation strategies rely on algorithmic 
automation, overlooking the impact of human judgment and cultural 
influence in fact interpretation. Previous studies have demonstrated that 
controversial topics and those lacking clear scientific consensus are 
more susceptible to hallucinations and proposed frameworks for the 
assessment of response accuracy and hallucinations (Mc Intosh et al., 
2024). From a scientific standpoint, hallucination assessment can sup-
port the testing and design of more accurate models. However, to 
address ethical concerns, the integration of user-centric fallback mech-
anisms might be necessary, such as informing the user when a reply is 
deemed to be of low-confidence. On another hand, it is argued that in-
stitutions implementing AI tools for student-centered learning should 
develop AI training programs to improve the AI literacy and criticality 
skills of students and ensure that AI does not negatively affect their 
learning outcomes.
Additionally, questions about liability arise from a plethora of issues 
ranging from plagiarism to poor learning outcomes and illicit use of AI 
tools. Outdated legal frameworks struggle to address issues such as the 
reliability for AI-based hallucinations (Khawaldeh, 2024), copyright of 
AI generated content, and so forth. It is envisioned that HE institutions 
will increasingly involve their legal departments to update their 
AI-related risk mitigation strategies, from assessment design to the 
development of rules around the use of internal and external AI systems.
Strategic recommendations for advancing AI-based student-centered 
framework include: (1) fostering interdisciplinary collaborations be-
tween educators, technologists, and policy-makers to co-design AI-based 
solutions; (2) prioritizing inclusivity by integrating accessibility and 
equity measures from the design stage; (3) adopting iterative evaluation 
cycles to align emerging AI capabilities with pedagogical goals; and (4) 
developing governance models that balance innovation with compli-
ance, transparency, and ethical safeguards. These steps will help ensure 
that future AI-enhanced educational ecosystems are not only technically
