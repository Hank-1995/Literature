Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly being used in the field of early childhood education (ECE) to 
enhance learning and development among young children. Previous proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated 
that AI can effectively improve teaching and learning in ECE; however, there is a scarcity of knowledge about 
how these studies are conducted and how AI is used across these studies. We conducted this scoping review to 
evaluate, synthesize and display the latest literature on AI in ECE. This review analyzed 17 eligible studies 
conducted in different countries from 1995 to 2021. Although few studies on this critical issue have been found, 
the existing references provide up-to-date insights into different aspects (knowledge, tools, activities, and im-
pacts) of AI for children. Most studies have shown that AI has significantly improved children’s concepts 
regarding AI, machine learning, computer science, and robotics and other skills such as creativity, emotion 
control, collaborative inquiry, literacy skills, and computational thinking. Future directions are also discussed for 
researching AI in ECE.   
1. Introduction 
Artificial intelligence (AI, hereafter), sometimes called machine in-
telligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines or computers 
(Solanki et al., 2021). AI was used to emulate complex functions asso-
ciated with the human mind, such as sensing, learning, and predicting 
(Russell & Norvig, 2002). Since 1956, researching AI has been 
acknowledged as an academic discipline (Knapp, 2006). AI in education 
is a topic that educators and researchers are becoming increasingly 
interested in, since AI seems to make a significant contribution to edu-
cation by personalizing learning experiences. From robotic instruction 
to the invention of an automated system for scoring answer sheets, for 
instance, AI has a role to play in facilitating teaching, learning, and 
assessment. 
AI tools are increasingly being used in the field of early childhood 
education (ECE) to enhance learning and development among young 
children (Lin et al., 2020; Nan, 2020; Vartiainen et al., 2020). For 
instance, two recent studies tried to teach machine learning to children 
using AI robots (Lin et al., 2020; Vartiainen et al., 2020). However, there 
has been very little discussion about AI in ECE. A number of 
proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated that AI can effectively 
improve teaching and learning in ECE (e.g., Druga et al., 2019; Ge et al., 
2021; Jin, 2019a; Kewalramani et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Nan, 2020; 
Vartiainen et al., 2020; Williams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019); yet, there is a 
scarcity of knowledge about how these studies are conducted and how 
AI is used across these studies. 
1.1. AI in education 
The number of published studies on the subject has increased in 
lockstep with the growing usage of AI technology in education (Chen 
et al., 2020). The capacity to comprehend the essential processes and 
concepts underpinning AI in various products and services is termed as 
AI literacy (Burgsteiner et al., 2016; Kandlhofer et al., 2016). Ng et al. 
(2021) proposed a four-dimension framework of AI literacy, which 
covers knowing and understanding AI, using and applying AI, evaluating 
and creating AI, and AI ethics. There has recently been a surge of review 
papers on AI in education (e.g., Chassignol et al., 2018; Chen et al., 
2022, 2020; Goksel & Bozkurt, 2019; Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Zawacki- 
Richter et al., 2019; Zhang & Aslan, 2021). For instance, Chen et al. 
(2022) found that there are several major AI applications in education, 
such as intelligent tutoring systems for special education, natural lan-
guage processing for language education, educational robots for AI ed-
ucation, educational data mining for performance prediction, discourse 
; AI, Artificial intelligence; ECE, Early childhood education.

analysis in computer-supported collaborative learning, neural networks 
for teaching evaluation, affective computing for learner emotion 
detection, and recommender systems for personalization. Furthermore, 
some crucial facts were uncovered in Chen et al.’s (2020) review paper 
on AI in education. First, there was a growing interest in and impact of 
research on AI in education. Second, insufficient effort had been made to 
integrate deep learning technologies into educational settings. Third, 
traditional AI methods such as natural language processing were widely 
used in educational contexts, whereas more advanced techniques were 
rarely used. Finally, there was a scarcity of studies that employed AI 
technologies while simultaneously delving extensively into educational 
theories. We also observe that there is a lack of knowledge and discus-
sion on the role of AI in ECE, an educational area which is usually 
ignored in cutting-edge research. 
1.2. ECE is technologically upgraded 
Digital technologies are increasingly being used for teaching and 
learning in the early years. Several review studies were conducted to 
study the relationship between digital technology and ECE from the 
perspectives of technology-enhanced environment, learning achieve-
ment, and other aspects (Herodotou, 2018; Liu & Hwang, 2020; Mantilla 
& Edwards, 2019). Liu and Hwang (2020), for example, investigated the 
use of touchscreen mobile devices in ECE. They revealed that the most 
common application of digital technology in ECE was the use of 
touchscreen mobile devices to assist young children in developing their 
language skills. This finding is also confirmed by a recent survey in 
Singapore showing that digital technology use would affect children’s 
reading abilities in their early years (Mah et al., 2021). Berson et al. 
(2021, pp. 1–3) argue that the integration of digital technologies into 
ECE also implies that children have varying opportunities to learn and 
explore digitally, which would lead to unequal educational outcomes. 
Therefore, it is necessary to promote all sorts of digital technologies in 
ECE to ensure an early start of equity and social justice in the human 
society. However, AI technologies have not been emphasized in the 
previous reviews in terms of linking technology to ECE. Moreover, as 
stated 
by 
Yang 
(2021), 
most 
of 
the 
studies 
focusing 
on 
technology-enhanced ECE lack support from the curriculum theories 
and practices, leaving it less known whether technology integration in 
ECE is appropriate for young children. 
1.3. Research on AI in ECE 
Many existing studies explored how to teach AI knowledge or con-
cepts to university students (e.g., Kumar & Meeden, 1998; Mc Govern 
et al., 2011; Torrey, 2012). Few studies have been conducted to inves-
tigate the application of AI in early childhood (age 3–8 years old). 
However, more and more AI devices are appearing in children’s lives, 
such as voice personal assistants, household robots, and networked 
smart toys (Williams et al., 2019). AI promotes the creation and effec-
tiveness of systems, which are obviously very useful educational tools. 
AI tools are shown to improve teaching quality of teachers and the 
efficacy of teaching foreign languages to children (Fomichov & Fomi-
chova, 1995; Ge et al., 2021). Ge et al. (2021) designed a teaching 
quality evaluation model for kindergarten teachers. Result showed that 
the teaching quality evaluation model was effective, based on extreme 
gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm and technology services’ Res Net 
(TS-Res Net). In addition, other methods of the applications of AI in 
effective teaching were identified. For instance, according to the study 
by Fomichov and Fomichova (1995), it was found that the highly 
effective methods of teaching foreign languages to children (5–6 years 
old) were the theory of dynamic conceptual mappings (DCM-theory), 
the methods of emotionally imaginative teaching (EIT-methods), as 
combined with intelligent tutoring systems. 
Preliminary evidence shows that AI improves parents’ knowledge 
and children’s AI knowledge (Druga et al., 2019; Jin, 2019a; Kandlhofer 
et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2020; Williams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019; Williams 
et al., 2019, 2019) and inquiry skills (Kewalramani et al., 2021; Pren-
tzas, 2013; Vartiainen et al., 2020). Most importantly, the AI tools or 
platforms such as Zhorai (Lin et al., 2020), We Chat remote control (Nan, 
2020), Teachable Machine (Vartiainen et al., 2020), and Pop Bots (Wil-
liams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019) were found to be effective for learning AI 
concepts. Meanwhile, we found that robots were widely used in ECE. 
Researchers reported that AI tools including smart robots can enhance 
social interactions among children, making children more participated 
in learning activities (Druga et al., 2019; Kewalramani et al., 2021; 
Prentzas, 2013). However, although previous studies have brought these 
AI tools or platforms into early childhood classrooms and shown their 
positive effects (e.g., Lin et al., 2020; Nan, 2020; Vartiainen et al., 2020; 
Williams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019), very little has been known about the 
learning activities that are designed with the use of these AI tools for 
children. 
AI curriculum is increasingly being included into 21st century 
computing. Two AI tools (i.e., Pop Bots and Zhorai) have been used to 
design AI curriculum for ECE, helping young children understand the 
concept of AI or machine learning more easily (Lin et al., 2020; Wil-
liams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019). Firstly, the teaching method of the 
Pop Bots had indicated a positive impact on young children’s learning 
(Williams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019). Secondly, children’s participation 
rate had increased when learning machine knowledge via the conver-
sational aspect of the Zhorai platform (Lin et al., 2020). 
This scoping review provides a starting point for early childhood 
researchers and educators in terms of promoting research and practice 
related to AI. In addition, other key points in the use of AI tools in ECE 
may be overlooked, such as the characteristics of different AIs tools and 
successful teaching and learning of AI in early childhood projects. 
1.4. Research objectives and questions 
In view of the differences that may be caused by differences in 
research methods, participant characteristics, author’s country, AI tools 
and knowledge or activity evaluation found in the literature, this review 
aims to evaluate, synthesize and display the latest literature on AI in 
ECE, involving research design, AI tools, AI activities and research re-
sults. To achieve the objectives, we focused on articles about the 
application of AI in young children’s learning and development. In 
addition, the study puts forward possible directions for future AI 
research, aiming to establish a strong theoretical foundation and clarify 
factors that will hinder the efficient application of AI in the field of ECE. 
Through this scoping review, the following research questions (RQs) will 
be answered: 
RQ1: What AI-related activities have been used in ECE? 
RQ2: What AI-interfaced tools have been used in ECE? Meanwhile, 
what knowledge or concepts related to AI are embedded in these 
tools? 
RQ3: What methods have been used in researching AI in ECE? 
2. Methods 
This research project is a scoping review of published literature on AI 
in ECE. The methodology for this review is based on the framework 
outlined by Arksey and O’Malley (2005) and Levac et a. (2010). The 
scoping review went through five key stages: identifying the scoping 
review questions, identifying relevant studies, study selection, summa-
rizing and reporting the results, and drawing conclusions. 
2.1. Literature search 
The electronic databases used for the literature search included Ed-
ucation Resources Information Center (ERIC), IEEE, Scopus, EBSCO and 
Web of Science. The search was limited to written in English. In order to 
J. Su and W. Yang

facilitate database search, this study surveyed peer-reviewed academic 
articles published in all years. All articles are accessed from September 
to October 2021. Initially, we entered search terms such as “artificial 
intelligence”, “AI”, and “early childhood education”, but in order to 
narrow the results, we used a similar approach from Toh et al. (2016). 
The search string used for AI review was: “AI” OR “Artificial Intelli-
gence” OR “Deep learning” OR “Machine Learning” OR “Neural 
network*” OR “Support vector machine*” OR “Natural language pro-
cessing” OR “Chatbot*“AND “early childhood” OR “young child*” OR 
“preschool*” OR “kindergarten*” OR “pre-k*” OR “childcare” OR “child 
care” OR “day care” OR “children”. More information of the five search 
protocols can be found in Appendix 1. 
2.2. Selection of studies 
This review paper focuses on AI in ECE. The selected research studies 
were related from ECE and focused on analyzed the impact of AI on 
learning and teaching. The selected research studies should report AI as 
an educational tool. 6374 articles were found in the Education Re-
sources Information Center (ERIC), IEEE, Scopus, EBSCO, and Web of 
Science [14 from ERIC, 134 from Web of Science, 225 from EBSCO, 513 
from IEEE and 5488 from Scopus (n = 6374)]. All citations were im-
ported into the reference management software (End Notes) and dupli-
cate citations were removed manually. 
2.3. Exclusion of studies 
Five criteria for exclusion (EC) articles were removed. Firstly, 
exclusion criteria (E1) were articles that were not related to research 
topic and abstract (n = 6304). Secondly, exclusion criteria (E2) were 
duplicate studies (n = 16). Thirdly, exclusion criteria (E3) was papers 
that participants or settings not 3–8 years old (n = 3). Furthermore, 
exclusion criteria (E4) were papers that focus/topic not AI or Deep 
learning or Machine Learning or Neural network or support vector 
machine or natural language processing or chatbot (n = 13). Lastly, 
exclusion criteria (E5) were papers that focus not related to curriculum/ 
learning program/teaching (n = 21). 
2.4. Overview of the selected articles 
Seventeen articles that focused on AI in ECE were thoroughly 
reviewed (1995, 1 article; 2013, 1 article; 2016, 1 article; 2019, 5 arti-
cles; 2020, 4 articles; and 2021, 5 articles) (See Fig. 1). Different types of 
literature were included in this review, such as journal article, book 
chapter and conference paper. This process yielded 17 articles including 
4 research articles, 12 conference papers and one book chapter. The 
authors came from different cultural backgrounds and countries (e.g., 
United States, China, Australia, UK, Greece, Austria, Russia, Taiwan and 
Finland). Besides, the authors with the highest number of articles were 
from United States (e.g., Druga et al., 2019; Dwivedi, 2021; Lin et al., 
2020; Tseng et al., 2021; Williams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019), followed by 
China (e.g., Ge et al., 2021; Jin, 2019a, 2019b; Nan, 2020). IEEE Xplore 
is an online information delivery system contains various articles, 
including journals, conference papers, and magazines (Madarash-Hill & 
Hill, 2004). Finally, we found one article from the IEEE database 
(Kandlhofer et al., 2016). The sample size of the included studies ranged 
from 6 to 2842 participants. All 17 studies included male and female 
participants. From this scoping review, we show that this collection of 
articles is strong enough to represent effective AI studies in the ECE field, 
represented educational articles and nationalities from diverse coun-
tries. More characteristics of the included studies, such as type of article, 
participants, author’s name and country can be found in Appendix 2. 
2.5. The Coding Framework 
To the best of our knowledge, there is no theoretical framework for 
understanding AI in ECE research at present. As a result, we devised a 
framework to guide this review. To investigate the future development 
trend of AI in ECE, it is necessary to analyze existing literature in the 
areas of “AI activities”, “AI tools and knowledge”, and “research 
methods”, as shown in Fig. 2. These three categories were utilized to 
assess and analyze the literature, as elaborated below.

(1) AI activities 
Researchers discovered that AI-related education activities could 
engage children in acquiring authentic AI knowledge (Lin et al., 2020; 
Vartiainen et al., 2020; Williams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019; Williams et al., 
2019, 2019). Hands-on units, workshops, modules, and lectures are 
examples of these AI activities.  
(2) AI tools and knowledge 
AI learning tools and platforms developed by AI researchers include 
Zhorai, We Chat remote control, Teachable Machine, Pop Bots, Cogni-
mates AI platform, and Plush Pal (Druga & Ko, 2021; Lin et al., 2020; 
Nan, 2020; Tseng et al., 2021; Vartiainen et al., 2020; Williams, Park, & 
Breazeal, 2019). Furthermore, some AI tools developed by researchers 
were proven to be useful in teaching AI and machine learning ideas to 
children (Williams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019; Druga et al, 2019). AI 
knowledge encompasses the concepts of AI, computer science, and 
machine learning.  
(3) Research methods 
Mc Millan and Schumacher (2006) classify research methodologies as 
quantitative, qualitative, mixed, or analytical. We also identified spe-
cific methods used in the included studies. 
2.6. Procedure 
The procedure is identical to that of Levac, Colquhoun, and O’Brien’s 
(2010) study. Two coders convened an online discussion to examine the 
above coding scheme. Second, the two coders separately read the 
included articles and identified the essential information for each 
dimension of the coding scheme during the coding process. The con-
sistency of the coding findings had reached 90% at this point. Finally, 
the two coders negotiated the discordant coding results with the evi-
dence from the articles until the two coding lists were similar, and then 
completed the coding procedure. 
3. Results 
Basic characteristics of the 17 included studies are presented in 
Table 1. These characteristics includes author(s), publication year, 
publication title, research aims, research design, participants, AI tools, 
and main findings. Below, we focus on the ways of AI integration (ac-
tivities), intervention effects (if any), AI tools, and research designs 
employed to elaborate on the findings of this scoping review. 
3.1. AI integration activities and the effects 
Williams, Park, and Breazeal (2019) designed the Pop Bot curriculum 
(e.g., knowledge-Based Systems, supervised Machine Learning and 
Generative Music AI) and assessed its effectiveness (e.g., children’s 
learning and data recording with robot interaction) with 80 Pre-K and 
Kindergarten children (4–6 years old). This result shows that children’s 
understanding of AI concepts through integrating with the activities and 
further supported that robot can be a learning companion. Kandlhofer 
et al. (2016) applied methods of discovery- and inquiry-based learning, 
storytelling, and educational robotics to teach 10 different topics in AI 
and computer science to children. Results showed that introducing the 
basic of AI or computer science topics in a fun way worked well (e.g., 
discover knowledge, understand the concept of AI and complete every 
activity in each unit). Kewalramani et al. (2021) conducted the use of 
interactive AI to cultivate inquiry literacy in ECE settings. Two kinder-
garten children (age 4–5 years old) classrooms were surveyed in that 
study. The study showed that by interacting with AI toys, the in-
teractions can indeed stimulate children’s higher mental functions, 
promote creative, emotional and collaborative inquiries, and related 
literacy skills. In addition, Vartiainen et al. (2020) involved six children 
(3–9 years old) from Finland in using Google’s Teachable Machine in 
non-school settings. Through analysis of video recordings and in-
terviews, the results showed that machine learning systems enhanced 
children’s learning and computational thinking (Vartiainen et al., 
2020). 
In general, research shows that AI-related education activities could 
engage children in obtaining authentic knowledge regarding AI (Lin 
et al., 2020; Vartiainen et al., 2020; Williams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019; 
Williams et al., 2019, 2019). Furthermore, prior research also verified 
that the combination of emotionally imaginative teaching (EIT) methods 
and three teaching activities supported by intelligent tutoring systems 
could improve English reading skills (Fomichov & Fomichova, 1995). 
Moreover, Druga et al. (2019) used smart toys to investigate how young 
children perceive current AI technologies for comparing 102 children in 
four different countries (i.e., U.S.A, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden). 
Results showed that children in high socioeconomic status (SES) schools 
and childcare centers showed better understanding of the AI concepts 
(Druga et al., 2019). Obviously, children’s AI perception and expecta-
tions were influenced by SES and cultural backgrounds. In addition, 
Kandlhofer et al. (2016) found that early childhood is the crucial period 
for discovering the connection between AI applications and basic con-
cepts by children. The study conducted by Kewalramani et al. (2021) 
showed that AI activities enhanced young children’s interaction with 
teachers and peers. This was further demonstrated by Williams, Park, 
and Breazeal (2019) that early AI education can teach children to un-
derstand AI concepts in their daily lives. More information of the 
included studies regarding the AI education activities promoted for 
young children can be found in Table 2. 
3.2. AI tools and AI knowledge 
This section presents a summary of research tools and AI knowledge 
undertaken (Table 3 and Table 4). Several researchers in the AI field 
have developed AI learning tools or platforms, such as Zhorai, We Chat 
remote control, Teachable Machine, Pop Bots, Cognimates AI platform, 
and Plush Pal (Druga & Ko, 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Nan, 2020; Tseng 
et al., 2021; Vartiainen et al., 2020; Williams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019). 
The AI educational robots act as independent learning partners, teaching 
assistants and learning tutors. A few researchers found that children can 
learn and interact with AI robots (i Robi Q, Sponge Robot and Pa Pe Ro) 
and may consider robots (QRIO) as peers (Jim, 2013; Jin, 2019a; Tanaka 
et al., 2005, 2007). Some studies have shown that children learned 
knowledge (e.g., AI, computer science, robotics, and machine learning) 
through AI tools (Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2020; Williams, 
Park, & Breazeal, 2019; Williams et al., 2019, 2019). Furthermore, two 
AI tools (Pop Bots and Zhorai) designed AI curriculum for ECE, helping 
young children understood the concept of AI or machine learning more 
easily (Lin et al., 2020; Williams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019). Robotics was 
also used in special education area and good research results have been 
obtained (Agrawal et al., 2012; Bartlett, Estivill-Castro, Seymon, & 
Tourky, 2003; Giullian et al., 20 10, Oct ober; Scassellati, 2007). More 
summary of AI educational robot of the included studies can be found in 
Table 4. 
These AI tools were also found to be effective in teaching AI and 
machine learning concepts to children. Williams, Park, and Breazeal 
(2019) used the AI platform, Pop Bots, to evaluate children’s knowledge 
and 
found 
that 
children 
performed 
best 
in 
understanding 
knowledge-based systems, followed by supervised machine learning. 
Results from another study conducted by Druga et al, (2019) found that 
the intelligent agents such as smart robots (e.g., Jibo robot, Anki’s 
Cozmo robot and Amazon’s Alexa) can interact with children and taught 
them AI and coding knowledge. Moreover, Jin (2019b) found that 
family education assistant robots could develop good parenting skills. 
Also, Kandlhofer et al, (2016) study found that Robotics/Non-Robotics 
J. Su and W. Yang

tools, such as Bee-Bots, LEGO Mindstorms NXT, Cubelets, and standard 
LEGO bricks, can teach concepts related to AI, computer science and 
robotics with discovery learning and inquiry-learning methods. Table 5 
contains a more detailed explanation of how AI can be used to improve 
children’s AI knowledge. 
3.3. Research methods used in the included studies 
This section presents a summary of the research designs undertaken 
in the included studies. Four articles did not describe the research 
methods used (i.e., Jin, 2019a, 2019b; Nan, 2020; Fomichov & Fomi-
chova, 1995). For those with a clear research design, observations (6 
articles) are the most commonly used methods, followed by interviews 
and assessments (4 articles). For example, video data, pictures, obser-
vations, field notes, and semi-structured interviews have been used in 
Kandlhofer et al.’s (2016) study. Lin et al. (2020) assessed the knowl-
edge 
of 
machine 
learning 
and 
used 
pre-assessments 
and 
post-assessments to monitor children’s self-perception and learning 
motivation as an engineer. Williams, Park, and Breazeal (2019) used 
simple AI assessments to evaluate children’s knowledge regarding 
knowledge-based systems, supervised machine learning, and generative 
AI. More information of the research design can be found in Table 6. 
The majority of studies employed a qualitative design (e.g., Druga & 
Ko, 2021; Fomichov & Fomichova, 1995; Kewalramani et al., 2021; 
Prentzas, 2013; Vartiainen et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020). Six studies 
employed qualitative data collection approaches such as observation 
and interviews. Four studies were found to match the features of 
mixed-methods research (Druga & Ko, 2021; Ge et al., 2021; Kandlhofer 
et al., 2016; Tseng et al., 2021). Dwivedi (2021), for example, used a 
mixed-methods research design with both quantitative and qualitative 
data being collected and analyzed. 
4. Discussion 
This scoping review analyzed a total of 17 studies conducted in 
different countries from 1995 to 2021 regarding AI teaching tools, 
knowledge, activities, and impacts on learning and teaching in the 
crucial field of ECE. Different types of publications are included in this 
review, such as journal article, book chapter and conference paper. 
Although a relatively small number of studies on this critical issue have 
been found, the current scoping review provides cutting-edge insights 
into different aspects (knowledge, tools, activities, and impacts) of AI for 
children. 
This scoping review shows that most of the studies were conducted in 
developed Western countries (e.g., United States, Australia, UK, Greece, 
Austria, and Finland). Only four studies (i.e., Ge et al., 2021; Jin, 2019a, 
2019b; Nan, 2020) have been conducted in the Asia context. Most 
studies were found to use interviews, assessments and observations, 
followed by questionnaires. Qualitative data were generated to draw 
conclusions for the proof-of-concept or user studies. To enrich the 
literature in the emerging field of AI in ECE, quantitative data such as 
child developmental outcomes should be obtained to evaluate the 
effectiveness of AI integration in ECE. Although a variety of assessment 
instruments have been used in the evaluation studies of AI among 
children (e.g., pre-assessments, post-assessments), they were not rigor-
ously validated. Future work could consider other psychometrically

sound measurements to assess children’s self-perception, learning 
motivation, 
engagement, 
and 
knowledge 
acquired 
(e.g., 
knowledge-based systems, supervised machine learning, and generative 
AI; Williams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019). 
In terms of the AI activities, workshops, lessons and hand-on units 
have been widely used to inform the design of learning activities with 
the support of AI tools/platforms. The AI tools and platforms (e.g., 
Zhorai, We Chat remote control, Teachable Machine and Pop Bots) were 
found to be effective for teaching AI and machine learning concepts to 
children. Also, early childhood AI education uses robotics and other 
tangible products such as Bee-Bots, LEGO Mindstorms NXT, Cubelets, 
and standard LEGO bricks. However, not all robots used are related to AI 
technologies. Moreover, most of the AI platforms are designed to be 
deployed on the Internet using computer (e.g., SHAIEx, Zhorai), thus 
limiting the accessibility of AI for young children. How AI integration 
can be achieved in more embodied approaches such as AI-enabled robots 
should receive more attention from the international communities of 
ECE and educational technology research. 
Furthermore, a number of studies have shown that AI can dramati-
cally improve teaching and learning in ECE. For instance, studies have 
shown that AI has significantly improved children’s concepts regarding 
AI, machine learning, computer science, and robotics and other skills 
such as creativity, emotion control, collaborative inquiry, literacy skills, 
and computational thinking. Only one study has evaluated the teaching 
quality of teachers, which shows that the XGBoost Model was valid (Ge 
et al., 2021). Another study has designed AI teaching platforms to 
improved children’s learning enthusiasm (Nan, 2020). Moreover, Jin 
(2019a) found that two potential applications (e.g., Artificial Intelligent 
Teaching System and Evaluation of Artificial Intelligent System) were 
suitable for children. However, regarding the effects of AI integration in 
ECE, more studies are warranted to verify the findings of these studies 
that have been published on local conferences instead of credible in-
ternational research platforms. 
4.1. Limitations of the current review 
Our review has several limitations. First, given the number of studies 
included in this evaluation is relatively small, there may be gaps in the 
research findings. Some of these knowledge gaps have been discussed 
above. Second, social and economic factors was not considered in our 
synthesis of previous research evidence, which could have an impact on 
the application of AI technologies in ECE due to the widely existed 
digital divide in the early years (Berson et al., 2021, pp. 1–3). Finally, 
the effects of alternative AI tools and platforms have not been fully 
explored due to a lack of reliable evidence in the previous studies. 
4.2. Research and pedagogical implications 
It was revealed that the volume of eligible studies has expanded 
dramatically in recent years to investigate AI in ECE. We also notice that

several proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated that AI can posi-
tively impact on young children’s learning. The majority of studies focus 
on utilizing AI to improve children’s AI knowledge/literacy, with only a 
few studies looking towards using AI to facilitate teachers’ training and 
teaching. In comparison to quantitative and mixed methods, the quali-
tative method was more widely used in the previous studies regarding AI 
in ECE. 
According to this scoping review, we can summarize that there are at 
least two approaches to AI integration in ECE. First, intelligent tutoring 
system (ITS), or AI-enhanced e-learning systems (e.g. adaptive systems 
that select learning paths), can provide a supportive space for children’s 
personalized learning. This is because the powerful AI technology sup-
ported by big data will allow the interface or user model to adapt to 
children’s learning needs by simultaneously evaluating individuals’ 
cognitive states and learning needs (Prentzas, 2013). Second, Internet of 
toys, or networked smart toys, provide an age-appropriate solution for 
enhancing young children’s learning and development, especially AI 
literacy (Williams, Park, & Breazeal, 2019), inquiry skills (Kewalramani 
et al., 2021), social interactions (Ca˜namero & Lewis, 2016), and lan-
guage abilities (Fomichov & Fomichova, 1995). Future research is 
warranted to explore the theoretical mechanisms underlying these two 
approaches to AI integration in the field of ECE. 
Consistent with Prentzas (2013), this research synthesis demon-
strates the effectiveness of introducing AI into ECE to improve children’s 
language skills and adaptive behaviors (Shin et al., 2008), as well as 
teacher-child interactions in classrooms (Kawata et al., 2008; Tanaka 
et al., 2005, 2007). Also, similar to, this study investigates the learning 
activities of young children who are supported by AI devices (e.g., smart 
robots). We also summarized several data gathering methods utilized in 
previous studies and stressed the importance of AI in ECE. To our 
knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review that has been under-
taken to understand the application of AI in ECE. It is worth noting that,

this review showcases the variety of AI platforms/tools used for 
designing and implementing AI education for young children. Future 
research is needed to compare the strengths and weaknesses of these AI 
platforms/tools with both qualitative and quantitative data sources. 
This scoping review reveals that there is a lack of research on AI 
teaching/tutoring system that is suitable for children’s learning. Many 
studies have found that the AI-enhanced educational systems were very 
successful, focusing on other age groups (Yin et al., 2021; Lv et al., 2021; 
Sun et al., 2021). Therefore, it is worth spending time designing this kind 
of system for younger children. There are two key considerations for 
proposing this research direction. First, AI teaching systems can provide 
learning goals based on individuals (e.g., learning model, learning re-
sources and learning partners). Second, according to observable infor-
mation (e.g., facial expression, speech expression, and knowledge 
feedback), AI teaching systems can use big data to evaluate and monitor 
children’s cognitive, emotional and behavioral states. Different from 
traditional assessment of child learning, AI teaching systems may 
consider more comprehensive data when pointing out the weakness of 
children and providing appropriate methods in a short time (e.g., 
assessment of language development, physical exercise test, and intel-
ligence level test). 
Overall, more research works should be conducted to involve inte-
gration of AI technologies in ECE settings. Amongst these technologies, 
AI educational robots can integrate different disciplines of knowledge 
and multiple technologies simultaneously to greatly enrich children’s 
learning experiences in our rapidly changing digital society.
