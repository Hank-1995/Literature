This paper presents findings from a mixed-method analysis of a generative AI tool, ERNIE Bot’s research status 
and role in education based on research from 2019–May 2025. Leveraging scientometric analysis, the study 
explored a combination of bibliometric and discourse analyses to uncover trends and language use. Using the 
PRISMA model, 147 publications from Scopus database were analyzed and insights from Cite Space and VOS-
viewer were combined with thematic analysis. Findings indicate that Chinese researchers, and China-based 
funding bodies are the most prominent in ERNIE-bot-related research with all the top 5 countries concen-
trated in the global north. Top themes include ‘Natural Language Model’, ‘Semantics’, and ‘Human’. Topmost 
publishers were Applied Sciences (Switzerland), IEEE Access and PLOS ONE with top average citations by Sensors 
(12.67 citations/publication). The study confirms Bradford and Price laws. ERNIE Bot’s application in education 
has attracted notable attention, with 22.4 % of the analyzed studies focusing on this area, highlighting its strong 
potential in personalized learning and human-computer interaction. Findings from discourse analysis shows that 
it’s Chinese origin is often framed as a symbol of contextual leadership and basis for positioning ERNIE Bot as a 
key player in China’s technological competition with global models like Chat GPT. ERNIE Bot’s strengths in 
Chinese language processing and innovations are also highlighted regarding power relations and knowledge 
hierarchies. However, ERNIE Bot lags global counterparts in overall competitiveness; limitations in data di-
versity, political censorship, and accessibility further restricts its global applicability. Future research should 
explore ERNIE Bot’s knowledge base, its educational potentials, especially in adaptive learning systems and the 
significance of contextual leadership as an educational technology.
1. Introduction
The integration of technology in teaching and learning has revolu-
tionized traditional pedagogical methods, transforming them into more 
dynamic, interactive, and personalized experiences (Edwards et al., 
2021). Among recent advancements, Generative Artificial Intelligence 
(Gen AI) tools have gained increasing attention for their capacity to 
support several educational concepts and processes including intelligent 
tutoring systems, personalized content delivery, automated assessment, 
and student engagement (Chen et al., 2025; van Haastrecht et al., 2024). 
These tools are not only transforming pedagogical strategies but are also 
being examined for their potential to contribute to educational equity, 
quality, and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 4 on 
Quality Education (Nedungadi et al., 2024). Recent research has 
highlighted the importance of critically examining how Gen AI in-
fluences learner motivation, teacher-student interaction, and pedagog-
ical values. Li et al. (2025), for instance, explored how Gen AI chatbots 
mediate student engagement through self-determination theory, illus-
trating that these tools are more than just technical systems, they 
reshape learning experiences and educational relationships.
ERNIE Bot (Enhanced Representation from Knowledge Integration; 
Chinese: 文心一言, Wenxin Yiyan), developed by Baidu and released in 
2023, is China’s first mainstream Gen AI chatbot. It was launched as a 
direct competitor to Chat GPT. Built upon the ERNIE foundation model 
(in development since 2019) (Zhang et al., 2019), ERNIE Bot has rapidly 
evolved across multiple iterations, culminating in Wenxin 4.5 Turbo and 
Wenxin X1 Turbo by 2025. As reported by Baidu (2025) these models 
surpass Chat GPT4o in several benchmark tasks and are now freely

available to individual users. Unlike English-centric Large Language 
Models (LLM), ERNIE Bot is specifically optimized for Chinese semantics 
and cultural reasoning. It performs exceptionally well in tasks involving 
historical allusions, classical Chinese poetry, and context-sensitive in-
terpretations, areas where Western models typically underperform 
(Wangsa et al., 2024).
Baidu’s CEO, Robin Li, has stated that as a Chinese company, Baidu’s 
LLM “has to perform better than any pre-trained LLMs” in understanding 
the Chinese language and context (Yang, 2023). This ambition is sup-
ported by Baidu’s robust infrastructure: it ownership of proprietary 
Chinese-language resources such as Baidu search engine, encyclopedia, 
forum, and content platforms, providing access to trillions of web pages, 
billions of search and speech data, and a 550-billion-fact knowledge 
graph (Xiao et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2025). It has also developed its 
own AI chip, Kunlun, which supports model training amid growing U. 
S.-China tensions over semiconductors.
Despite its technical maturity and widespread use with over 450 
million users (Baidu Baike, n. d.) as of November 2024, ERNIE Bot re-
mains underrepresented in scholarly literature, especially in the context 
of educational applications and discourse framing (Wangsa et al., 2024). 
Compared to the extensive scientometric attention given to Chat GPT, 
little is known about how ERNIE Bot functions as an epistemic agent in 
Chinese-language learning, knowledge dissemination, and value for-
mation. As a non-Western, culturally localized LLM, ERNIE Bot emerges 
as a significant research topic. This study aims to fill this gap through 
scientometric analysis, systematically exploring the current state of 
research on ERNIE Bot. To identify trends, patterns, and key contribu-
tors in the research landscape surrounding ERNIE Bot, bringing to light 
its possible contributions to education, and actual comparison to 
Chat GPT, as a competitor. In addition, By combining discourse analysis, 
language use in the publications was also examined to identify the 
relevant assumptions and idea.
The five main research objectives focusing on biblometric and 
discourse analyses are presented below; the relevant research questions 
for each objectives are presented in the results section.

and future research directions.
2. Literature review
Scientometric reviews are built upon research methodologies 
commonly used in the field of bibliometrics, which is the study of 
quantitative aspects of written communication, including publications, 
citations, and bibliographic data (Van Raan, 1997). The significance of 
scientometric analysis lies in its ability to evaluate research perfor-
mance, identify emerging research areas, analyze research collaboration 
patterns, and ultimately provide a basis for optimizing research resource 
allocation and improving research policies (Gomis et al., 2023).
LLM are a subset of Gen AI designed specifically for processing tex-
tual data. They generate new content by learning from vast amounts of 
text data (Chan & Hu, 2023). Gen AI holds significant potential in the 
education sector, with application in personalized learning, writing 
assistance, and automated grading (Darvishi et al., 2024). However, it 
also presents challenges like accuracy, academic integrity, and data bias 
(Khlaif et al., 2023). Currently, educational institutions hold varying 
attitudes toward Gen AI, some opting to ban it, while others encourage 
exploration (M. Mijwil et al., 2023).
Gen AI encompasses various model types, with Transformer models 
being the most popular and successful type to date (Wang, Song, et al., 
2022; Xiu et al., 2023). ERNIE Bot as an LLM based on the Transformer 
architecture, has an advantage in understanding Chinese culture and 
language (Wangsa et al., 2024). It is capable of performing a wide range 
of tasks, such as text generation, answering questions, and composing 
poetry. Its development leverages multiple technologies, including 
knowledge-enhanced pretraining (Guo & Wang, 2022; Sun et al., 2020, 
pp. 8968–8975; Yuan et al., 2023), continual multitask learning (Sun 
et al., 2020, pp. 8968–8975), and prompt-based fine-tuning (Wang et al., 
2023a). While ERNIE Bot excels in handling various Chinese dialects, it 
also has some limitations, such as restricted accessibility, potential bias 
and censorship issues, as well as concerns regarding factual accuracy 
and reliability (Rudolph et al., 2023). Based on these contextual capa-
bilities of ERNIE Bot, the LLM is also expected to demonstrate excep-
tional context awareness in relation to the Chinese context.
To further clarify the research gaps related to ERNIE, we conducted a 
comparative analysis of the only two review articles that examine Gen AI 
and LLMs, including ERNIE. Table 1 presents a summary of the key 
characteristics and findings from these studies.
While existing reviews have included ERNIE among a broader set of 
LLMs, their analyses remain superficial in scope and limited in educa-
tional depth. As shown in Table 1, prior studies have primarily adopted a 
horizontal comparative lens, situating ERNIE alongside more globally 
dominant models like Chat GPT and Bard, without delving into its 
distinctive roles within localized educational contexts or the discourse 
structures that shape its legitimacy. Furthermore, these reviews lack 
integrated methodological approaches capable of connecting biblio-
metric trends with the socio-educational narratives embedded in ERNIE- 
related publications. Notably absent are investigations into how ERNIE 
is framed in relation to teacher agency, knowledge hierarchies, and 
cultural-political narratives in education.
To address these critical gaps, the present study offers a focused and 
mixed-method investigation of ERNIE Bot’s trajectory as an educational 
tool. By combining scientometric mapping with discourse analysis, this 
research not only captures the quantitative expansion of ERNIE-related 
studies but also reveals the underlying rhetorical strategies, ideological 
framings, and institutional affiliations that shape its positioning. This 
dual-layered approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of 
ERNIE Bot’s pedagogical significance, particularly in non-Western 
educational systems, and contributes to broader debates on AI locali-
zation, epistemic sovereignty, and human-centered educational design.
3. Methodology
3.1. Research design and framework: PRISMA
This study utilizes scientometric analysis as a key method for con-
ducting a systematic literature review (SLR). The method adopted a 
mixed method analyses of the literature and covers a quantitative bib-
liometric analysis and a qualitative discourse analysis. Together, these 
methods enable a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the

literature, providing valuable insights into both established and 
emerging research fields.
The research process follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys-
tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) model, utilizing the 
PRISMA statement template to guide data selection. This model offers a 
structured approach for conducting systematic reviews and meta- 
analyses, promoting transparency, reproducibility, and the rigorous 
evaluation of research findings (Page et al., 2021). There are four pro-
cesses involved in using the PRISMA template, namely identification, 
screening, eligibility, and ultimately establishing which studies were 
included in the review.
3.2. Sampling and database selection
The primary data source for this study is the Scopus database. Scopus 
indexes a wide range of top databases, including Web of Science 
(comprehensive database of scholarly literature), MEDLINE (free data-
base of biomedical literature), and EMBASE (database of biomedical and 
pharmaceutical information) as well as content from over 21,950 peer- 
reviewed journals, 280 trade publications, over 560 book series, more 
than 150,000 books, and over 8 million conference papers (Baas et al., 
2020). Scopus has become a widely accepted data source in bibliometric 
research due to its extensive journal coverage, rigorous quality assur-
ance, and compatibility with leading bibliometric tools such as VOS-
viewer and Cite Space (Mongeon & Paul-Hus, 2016).
3.3. Screening and inclusion/exclusion criteria
In the identification stage, using "ERNIE" as the keyword, an updated 
retrieval was conducted on June 1, 2025. Resulting in 1132 related 
documents. In the screening stage, this study included peer-reviewed 
articles and reviews published in English between 2019 and 2025. The 
peer-review process ensures the quality and reliability of these publi-
cations. Although ERNIE Bot was launched in 2023, its foundation is the 
general-purpose large model "ERNIE," released in 2019 (Zhang et al., 
2020). This model has been applied and studied in various fields. By 
analyzing early literature related to the ERNIE model, researchers can 
gain insights into its development history, technological evolution, and 
application trends, providing a more comprehensive background for 
studying ERNIE Bot. 930 articles were eliminated, leaving 202 articles. 
In the qualification stage, specific quality criteria were systematically 
applied. The title or abstract of the paper had to explicitly mention the 
name of ERNIE Bot or contain an application analysis of the ERNIE 
model. In the full text analysis stage, papers were selected based on their 
understanding of the advantages, disadvantages, comparison, review, 
benchmark or impact of the performance of ERNIE model. At this stage, 
55 articles unrelated to the ERNIE model, as well as preprints, officially 
retracted articles, and duplicates, were removed. Finally, 147 articles 
were included in the research report.
To ensure the consistency and reliability of the dataset, a data 
normalization procedure was conducted prior to analysis, following the 
framework proposed by Taskin et al. (2019), and informed by the 
methodological guidelines of Strotmann and Zhao (2012) and Van Eck 
and Waltman (2018). Specifically, the author and source fields were 
standardized to distinguish authors with similar names. The dataset was 
also reviewed to identify any journal title changes that may have 
occurred within the last one decade, in order to avoid inconsistencies 
caused by renamed journals. Lastly, the keywords were harmonized by 
unifying grammatical forms and singular/plural variations, which hel-
ped reduce redundancy and enhance the accuracy of the co-word 
network analysis. Fig. 1 shows the details of the screening and inclu-
sion/exclusion procedure based on the PRISMA template.

Cite Space and VOSviewer (Pan et al., 2018). Cite Space applies a 
set-theoretic approach to data normalization, utilizing similarity algo-
rithms to generate timeline views within defined time slices. These vi-
sualizations effectively trace the evolution of knowledge over time and 
reveal the historical span of literature within specific clusters, providing 
insights into the field’s development and trends (Chen, 2006). VOS-
viewer employs a probabilistic data normalization method and supports 
diverse visualization modes. These modes excel in displaying 
co-occurrence of keywords, co-authorships, and institutional collabo-
rations, offering user-friendly mapping (van Eck & Waltman, 2010). 
Qualitative analysis, including discourse analysis and analysis of power 
dynamics was based on thematic and content analysis. The texts were 
examined using Cite Space, VOSviewer as well as standard manual the-
matic procedures.
4. Results
Data analysis utilized scientometric methods, including quantitative 
and qualitative analyses. The results of the study is presented in the 
following 2 sub-sections. The first focuses on the quantitative analysis 
while the second focuses on discourse (qualitative) analysis.
4.1. Quantitative (Bibliometric) analysis
4.1.1. RO1: To identify the core areas of focus in past and current ERNIE 
Bot Research
RQ1a: How is research publications on ERNIE Bot distributed across 
the last 6 years?
Fig. 2 shows the publication timeline of research papers in the ERNIE 
model field. According to the VOSviewer analysis, the 147 articles were 
authored by 502 researchers from 380 organizations across 24 countries. 
They were published in 93 journals, and cited 6302 references from 
3297 journals. Overall, the number of publications in this field has been 
steadily increasing, particularly after 2023, when there was a rapid rise 
in the number of publications. In 2023 and up to May 2025, the number 
of publications has remained stable at over 25 papers, indicating that 
this research area has attracted increasing attention from scholars in 
recent years and has become a new focal point in Gen AI research. 
RQ1b: What are the key themes/keywords and topics emerging from 
the literature on ERNIE Bot research?
Keywords condense the core and essence of a paper. Through 
keyword co-occurrence analysis, we can find the research hotspots in a 
certain scientific field. Keyword density mapping of the articles was 
performed using VOSviewer to highlight the hotspots and high- 
frequency keywords (keywords with occurrence >5 times). Fig. 3, the 
density visualization map shows two major hotspots in the research 
landscape. The first, centered around keywords such as semantics, deep 
learning, and NLP, reflects the methodological core grounded in NLP 
technologies. The second density peak involves terms like human, large 
language model, and Chat GPT, indicating increasing attention toward 
the application implementation of large-scale AI models. Peripheral but 
connected terms, such as social media, gender factors and bench-
marking, may represent emerging niches within this evolving field.
In NLP, co-occurrence refers to the frequency with which two or 
more words appear together in a corpus of text. The VOSviewer provides 
a view of keyword co-occurrence. Table 2 presents the top 10 high- 
frequency keywords extracted from the co-occurrence analysis. In 
addition to keyword frequency (occurrences), the Total Link Strength 
(TLS) is used to assess each term’s overall connectivity within the 
keyword network (Pan et al., 2018). TLS represents the cumulative 
strength of co-occurrence links that a keyword shares with all other 
keywords in the dataset. A higher TLS indicates stronger thematic cen-
trality, suggesting that the term is not only frequently mentioned but 
also plays a key integrative role in connecting multiple research themes 
or clusters. Therefore, TLS helps distinguish between merely frequent 
terms and those that are thematically central within the research land-
scape. As the most frequently occurring term, large language model

demonstrates both a high occurrence rate (36) and a high TLS (144). As 
shown in Fig. 4, indicating its function as a thematic bridge between 
various methodological and application-driven clusters. In the network, 
it is centrally located and closely connected to both red (technical) and 
green (applied) clusters, symbolizing its role as a conceptual hub. As the 
seconed frequently occurring term, semantics demonstrates both a high 
occurrence rate (32) and a high TLS (112). Semantics is closely related to 
research on ERNIE Bot, referring to the meaning and interpretation of 
words, phrases, and sentences in context (Xu & Hu, 2021). Semantic 
analysis is crucial for enhancing ERNIE Bot’s understanding and gen-
eration of human language. ERNIE Bot research often focuses on how 
well the model grasps and utilizes semantic information to improve its 
NLP capabilities (Lv & Ding, n.d.; Ou et al., 2022; Xu & Hu, 2021). As 
shown in Fig. 5, semantics primarily connects to technical research 
concerns in the red cluster, including deep learning, text classification, 
and named entity recognition. Its TLS score confirms its importance in

defining foundational NLP tasks and model interpretability, particularly 
in ERNIE’s semantic understanding framework. Although the 
co-occurrence frequency of the keyword “Human” (30) is slightly lower 
than that of “Large Language Model”, it has the highest TLS at 188, 
indicating exceptionally strong co-occurrence connections across 
different themes. As shown in Fig. 6, it serves as a central thematic 
anchor within the green cluster, linking to artificial intelligence, 
Chat GPT, controlled study, and China. This suggests that many studies 
focus on the human-centered dimensions of LLMs, such as user impact 
(Che et al., 2023), personalized learning (Zhu et al., 2025), and ethical 
use (Liu et al., 2025).
The VOSviewer provides a view of keyword co-occurrence network 
visualization with different colors indicating different clusters. The 
keyword co-occurrence network visualization in Fig. 7 illustrates the 
relationships between keywords through a network of nodes, color and 
connecting lines. Based on Fig. 7, the keyword co-occurrence network 
reveals two prominent thematic clusters, Table 3 shows the keyword 
clustering analysis of two different colors.
Cluster 1 represents the technical core of ERNIE Bot research, 
concentrating on deep learning models, semantic understanding, and 
task-oriented adaptation. The co-occurring keywords such as attention 
mechanism, BERT, Bi LSTM, text classification, named entity recogni-
tion, and transfer learning suggest a research emphasis on model ar-
chitecture optimization and language representation tasks. A number of 
studies explore how ERNIE enhances semantic modeling and classifi-
cation performance through architectural fusion (Ahmed et al., 2023;

Che et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Duan et al., 2025; Liao et al., 2024; 
Na et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2022). In addition, several works emphasize 
sentiment analysis and information extraction from social media (Che 
et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025; Lu et al., 2025; Mo 
et al., 2025; Wang, Song, et al., 2022). These studies frequently rely on 
components like Bi LSTM and attention modules to enhance ERNIE’s 
performance, particularly in Chinese-language environments where 
syntactic-semantic richness poses challenges to standard LLMs. Overall, 
Cluster 1 defines the technical and task-driven dimension of ERNIE 
research, with a focus on adapting model architectures for structured 
prediction, extraction, and classification in diverse domains ranging 
from construction and healthcare to public opinion mining.
Cluster 2 brings together research focusing on human involvement, 
controlled evaluation, and the cultural contextualization of LLMs. 
Representative keywords include human, Chat GPT, China, controlled 
study, comparative study, Chinese, and large language model, high-
lighting a distinctive concern with real-world human impact, fairness, 
and adaptability across linguistic and demographic contexts. Several 
studies reflect this direction. Their evaluation focused on data accuracy 
and human-AI interaction in generating nursing feedback, addressing 
both technical quality and real-world usability from an educational and 
clinical standpoint (Cheng et al., 2025; He et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2024; 
Shuyan Zeng, 2024). Overall, this cluster reveals a strong interdisci-
plinary convergence around language, human evaluation, and educa-
tional relevance. It captures the growing demand to contextualize ERNIE 
Bot not just as a model of semantic capability, but as a deployable, 
observable system interacting with real-world users in controlled, 
culturally nuanced environments. 
RQ1c: How have key research themes evolved over time?
To capture the temporal dynamics of research themes associated 
with ERNIE Bot, a timeline view was generated using Cite Space. Node 
labeling was sorted by degree centrality to highlight highly connected 
terms. Fig. 8 show a timeline view generated by Cite Space based on co- 
occurrences of keywords, titles, category, and abstracts. Each vertical 
line represents a time slice, with the appearance of terms indicating the 
first occurrence of a concept during that year. Node size reflects the 
frequency of occurrence, and links represent co-occurrence relation-
ships. The gradient color on the timeline captures the evolution of 
ERNIE-related research from 2019 to May 2025.
In the initial stage (2019–2021), the literature focused predomi-
nantly on foundational NLP techniques, including semantic represen-
tation, information extraction, and model optimization. High-frequency 
keywords such as “NLP,” “semantics,” “classification (of information)” 
reflect ERNIE’s early identity as a BERT-based architecture designed for 
enhanced entity-level encoding in Chinese.

The intermediate phase (2022–2023) marked a transition towards 
applied and contextualized tasks, particularly in affective computing, 
emotion recognition, and social media text processing. Central keywords 
included “sentiment analysis,” “emotion,” “social media,” and “human,” 
underscoring the model’s increasing involvement in public-facing lan-
guage contexts.
In the most recent phase (2024–May 2025), ERNIE Bot research has 
increasingly moved into comparative LLM evaluation and education 
system integration, often in direct dialogue with Chat GPT and other 
global models. Keywords such as “Chat GPT,” “controlled study,” 
“learning systems,” and “large language model” dominate this phase. 
Several studies exemplify this trend by empirically assessing ERNIE 
alongside international counterparts in instructional scenarios, adaptive 
testing, and system-level benchmark accuracy (Fan & Chen, 2024; Guo 
et al., 2025; He et al., 2024; Hong et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2024; Othman 
et al., 2024; Shuyan Zeng, 2024; Wei et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025). This 
thematic progression reflects a broader epistemic shift from technical 
development to cognitive application, and ultimately to contextualized 
educational deployment. ERNIE Bot is no longer framed merely as a 
performance NLP tool but is increasingly positioned as a culturally and 
politically situated LLM, especially within China’s educational and 
technological narratives.
4.1.2. RO2: To identify influential actors in research on ERNIE bot
Five (5) sub-questions were raised to address this objective. They 
were focused on covering a) major journals, b) key researchers, c) in-
stitutions and countries, d) funding sources, and e) most impactful 
research outputs. The following sub-sections present the findings. 
RQ2a: Which journals and conferences are the most frequent pub-
lishers of research on ERNIE Bot?
To identify the core journals contributing to ERNIE Bot research, 
Table 4 summarizes the publication sources with three or more related 
articles. Applied Sciences and IEEE Access are the most prolific journals, 
each publishing 11 papers. Applied Sciences leads in total citations (95), 
with an average of 8.64 citations per article, indicating its central role in 
disseminating ERNIE-related research. Notably, Sensors, despite pub-
lishing only 3 articles, ranks first in average citation per publication 
(12.67), suggesting a higher citation impact per article. This implies that 
while Sensors may not be a high-output journal in this field, the quality 
or visibility of the ERNIE Bot research it publishes is comparatively 
strong. The journal Advanced Engineering Informatics, although also 
contributing just 3 articles, shows a respectable average citation rate of 
7.33. This suggests that specialized journals with focused technical au-
diences may yield stronger per-paper impact than higher-output 
generalist journals.
When analyzing the distribution pattern of research literature across 
journals, Bradford (1934)’s law is often used for validation. The law 
proposes that within a seemingly chaotic collection of scientific and 
technical literature, the distribution of professional literature follows a 
highly asymmetric or skewed pattern. There is a certain quantitative 
relationship between professional literature and the journals in which it 
is published. If scientific journals are arranged in decreasing order based 
on the number of papers they publish on a particular subject, the jour-
nals can be divided into a core zone and several subsequent zones. The 
number of papers published in each zone is roughly equal and follows a 
‘1:a:a2:..’ ratio. These zones in ERNIE Bot research publications from 
2019 to May 2025 are shown in Table 5. In line with Bradford’s Law, 
core journals, relevant journals, and marginal journals can be identified. 
The source distribution of ERNIE Bot-related publications between 2019 
and May 2025 was analyzed using Bradford’s Law to assess the con-
centration of research across journals. Journals were ranked in 
descending order based on the number of publications and then divided 
into three zones according to publication productivity.
As shown in Table 5, the first zone includes 2 journals contributing a 
total of 22 publications, the second zone includes 7 journals with 27 
publications, and the third zone includes 86 journals contributing 99 
publications. Although the number of publications across the zones 
(22:27:99) does not form a perfectly equal distribution, the overall 
pattern reveals a highly skewed concentration consistent with Brad-
ford’s empirical observation. The sharp drop in productivity from core 
to peripheral journals supports the presence of a Bradford-type distri-
bution, where a small number of journals account for a disproportion-
ately large share of research output. The results indicate that ERNIE Bot 
research, while dispersed across many sources, remains highly concen-
trated in a few core journals such as Applied Sciences and IEEE Access.
Document co-citation analysis (Chen, 2018) is an essential tool for 
understanding the history, temporal progression, and trends within a 
research field. This methodology enables the uncovering of how 
different research streams and topics have evolved over time, helping to 
answer questions about the historical context and emerging trends in the 
field. Using VOSviewer to assess the co-citation network of journals 
(Fig. 9) reveals five distinct clusters, these clusters reflect how different 
knowledge domains contribute to the evolution of the field. The top 
sources with the most co-citations are ar Xiv (192), IEEE Access (82), and 
Advanced Engineering Informatics (34). The red cluster, centered on IEEE 
Access, Advanced Engineering Informatics, and Knowledge-Based Systems, 
represents the technical and algorithmic core of ERNIE-related litera-
ture. Journals in this group emphasize model architecture, information 
extraction, and task-oriented NLP optimization, which are foundational 
to early ERNIE developments. The blue cluster is dominated by ar Xiv by 
far the most frequently co-cited source along with Sensors, Electronics, 
and Aerospace. This group reflects the pre-publication dissemination of 
ERNIE-related computational research, as well as its uptake in real-time, 
sensor-rich, and embedded system contexts. The presence of Sensors and 
Electronics suggests an emergent trend of integrating ERNIE into 
Internet of Things and context-aware computing, expanding its rele-
vance beyond pure language tasks. Anchored by Nature, Radiology, and 
the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the green 
cluster captures the biomedical and high-impact science applications of 
ERNIE and other LLMs. While not dominant in volume, these journals 
are often referenced in discussions around clinical NLP, ethical con-
cerns, and AI interpretability in medical settings. Their connection to

ERNIE-related research indicates a growing interdisciplinary push to 
explore how Chinese-language LLM like ERNIE can support 
decision-making in healthcare domains. Yellow cluster includes journals 
such as Sustainability, International Journal of Environmental Research and 
Public Health, and Landscape and Urban Planning. It reflects the incor-
poration of ERNIE-based AI tools into urban governance, public opinion 
monitoring, and sustainability education. Such applications often align 
with research on public discourse, smart city planning, and civic edu-
cation, especially in Chinese and Southeast Asian contexts. The presence 
of this cluster demonstrates the social policy and environmental rele-
vance of LLM in localized governance systems. Comprising journals like 
Expert Systems with Applications and Government Information Quarterly, 
the purple cluster highlights ERNIE’s role in decision support systems, 
recommendation algorithms, and public sector digital transformation. 
Articles in this group commonly discuss hybrid AI architectures that 
embed ERNIE for task-specific outputs, including recommendation, 
prediction, or citizen service improvement. This cluster connects 
AI-driven research with broader administrative intelligence and digital 
governance trends.
Taken together, these clusters demonstrate that ERNIE-related 
scholarship spans far beyond linguistics or NLP benchmarks. The 
prominence of clusters relating to engineering, preprint dissemination, 
biomedical applications, environmental governance, and decision sys-
tems reveals ERNIE’s increasing role as an epistemic bridge across 
technical, institutional, and public domains. The diversity of co-citation 
sources underscores the model’s interdisciplinary diffusion and sets the 
foundation for future hybrid research integrating ERNIE Bot into 
educational, medical, and policy-oriented systems. 
RQ2b: Who are the key researchers, institutions, and countries 
contributing to ERNIE Bot research?
i. Who are the key researchers contributing to ERNIE Bot research?
Analyzing the authors of the literature allows us to identify the 
leading scholars and core research forces in the field. Renowned scholar 
Price (1963) noted that, within a specific subject, half of the papers are 
authored by a group of highly productive authors. The size of this author 
group is approximately equal to the square root of the total number of 
authors. 
∑
max
x=m+1
n(x) =
̅̅̅̅
N
√
In this context, n(x) represents the number of authors who have 
published x papers, nmax refers to the number of papers published by the 
most prolific author in the field (as determined by VOSviewer, nmax =
13, “N = 503” is the total number of authors, and “m” is the minimum 
number of publications required to qualify as a core author. According 
to Price’s Law, the minimum number of publications by core authors can 
be calculated using the formula: 
m = 0.749 ×
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
nmax
√
≈ 0.749 ×
̅̅̅̅̅̅

√
≈ 3.6 
Thus, authors with a publication count of 4 or more are considered 
core authors in this field. Based on statistical analysis, there are 24 core 
authors in this field, the observed number of core authors (24) closely 
aligns with the theoretical square root of the total author population 
(
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅

√
≈ 22.4), validating the empirical application of Price’s Law.” 24 
core authors with a total of 94 publications, accounting for 63.9 % of the 
total publication output, aligning with Price’s "50 % rule". Table 6
presents the top five core authors with the highest average citations in 
this field.

Among the high-average citation core authors, Professor Sun Yining 
from the Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 
has the highest average citation. Analysis shows that the two ERNIE- 
related papers he co-authored “An ERNIE-based Joint Model for Chi-
nese Named Entity Recognition” and “Named Entity Recognition in 
Chinese Medical Literature Using Pretraining Models” were both jointly 
completed with Professor Xu Yang (ranked second) from the Hefei In-
stitutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Professor 
Wang Yusong from Anhui Medical University, China (ranked fifth), who 
is also the first author of both papers (Wang et al., 2020a, Wang et al., 
2020b). Professor Wang Yusong has 11 publications, with four on ERNIE 
research which listed him as the first author. This further highlights his 
central influence in shaping the ERNIE Bot research landscape in clinical 
NLP. His work demonstrates a sustained focus on applying pre-trained 
language models to Chinese medical text processing. His empirical 
studies span multiple NLP tasks, named entity recognition (Wang et al., 
2020a, Wang et al., 2020b), relation extraction (Wang et al., 2023b), 
and text classification (Wang et al., 2023a), all grounded in real-world 
medical corpora. In addition, the analysis also shows that a relatively 
stable group of core author collaborations has been established in the 
fields of ERNIE Bot research. 
ii. Which institutions are the key contribut to ERNIE Bot research?
Table 7 illustrates the top 5 contributors to the number of papers in 
this field. Tsinghua University with 3 publications, followed by the 
Sungkyunkwan University (South Korea) with 3, Anhui Province Key 
Laboratory of Medical Physics and Technology with 2, Baidu Research 
with 2, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences with 2, This distri-
bution underscores the substantial contributions of Chinese institutions 
to the research and development of ERNIE Bot, highlighting their 
prominent role in advancing AI and NLP technologies. These findings 
also emphasize the need for more engagement from non-Chinese re-
searchers in this field to provide a more balanced perspective on the 
research landscape and to fully realize its global potential. 
iii. Which Countries are the key contribut to ERNIE Bot research?
We used VOSviewer to analyze the publication output from 24 
countries/regions. Table 8 presents the average citation information of 
the top five countries in the field of ERNIE Bot research, while Fig. 10
highlights the geographical distribution map of countries conducting 
research on ERNIE Bot. Table 8 shows that Chinese scholars have 
contributed the most publications in this field, accounting for 73.8 % of 
the total publications. The average citation count for these publications 
is 4.72. This is consistent with the fact that ERNIE Bot originated in 
China, and the in-depth research and application by companies such as 
Baidu in the field of NLP have greatly advanced the development of this 
field. China’s scientific research institutions, universities, and enter-
prises have closely collaborated to drive innovation in the ERNIE model 
and its related technologies. Singapore’s average citation ranks first, 
although it has published only 4 articles, they have garnered a 
remarkable 426 citations, resulting in an average of 106.50 citations per 
paper. This highlights the presence of highly influential, breakthrough 
studies from Singapore. United Kingdom with 6 publications and 43 
citations, resulting in an average citation count of 12 per paper. United 
States, with 12 articles and 53 citations, averaging 4.42 citations per 
publication. As a global hub for scientific and technological innovation, 
the U.S. has made significant contributions to the fields of AI and NLP. 
Notably, some of the country authors are of Chinese origin, reflecting the 
strong international flow of talent and scientific research cooperation. 
Other countries such as the South Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan and so on 
have also made important contributions to this field. It may be note-
worthy that these countries are geographically close to China or share 
political and economic cooperation. Fig. 10 show the concentration of 
these countries in the ‘global north’ may also have significance for the 
impact of economic factors on research trends, highlighting the need for 
future directions in research funding. With the absence of contributions 
from the physical and global ‘south’ (there is a single paper from South 
Africa, two from Australia), the finding highlights a huge funding gap for 
China that has the potential to promote ERNIE Bot research opportu-
nities. In addition, it also underscores the potentials for relevant 
collaborative research with researchers from the underrepresented 
regions. 
RQ2c: What are the primary funding sources for research on ERNIE 
Bot?
Fig. 11 displays the top 6 primary funding sources by number of 
supported publications. The National Natural Science Foundation of 
China leads by funding 47 related papers. National Key Researchand 
Development Program of China and Fundamental Research Funds for the 
Central Universities follow, supporting 15 and 4 papers, respectively. 
These data underscore the significant contributions of Chinese in-
stitutions to the development of ERNIE Bot, and their active role in 
advancing the fields of Gen AI and NLP. 
RQ2d: What are the most cited papers and seminal works on research 
on ERNIE Bot?
Assessment of the top three most-cited documents (2019 to May 
2025), reveals significant insights, as shown in Table 9. The most cited 
and foundational paper in ERNIE Bot-related research is War of the 
Chatbots: Bard, Bing Chat, Chat GPT, Ernie and Beyond. The New AI Gold 
Rush and Its Impact on Higher Education by Rudolph et al. (2023), with 
424 citations. This article serves as a landmark comparative review that 
analyzes the emergence and implications of LLMs-including ERNIE 
Bot-within the context of higher education. The study systematically 
evaluates four leading AI chatbots (Chat GPT, Bing Chat, Bard, and

ERNIE), focusing on their performance, accessibility, and pedagogical 
impact. ERNIE was excluded from empirical testing due to access limi-
tations. Despite this, ERNIE is critically discussed as a culturally distinct 
Chinese counterpart to Western LLMs. Importantly, the article integrates 
both English and Chinese-language academic sources, providing one of 
the earliest bilingual academic comparisons of ERNIE with global 
counterparts. It also outlines implications for students, faculty, in-
stitutions, and policymakers, calling for nuanced engagement with AI 
tools rather than outright bans. This paper’s influence stems not only 
from its empirical breadth but also from its critical discussion of ERNIE’s 
limitations in terms of transparency, accessibility, and geopolitical 
positioning. As such, it represents a foundational reference for under-
standing ERNIE’s role in global AI discourse, particularly within 
educational settings.

2023), with 36 citations. The study compares several models on 16,000 
Chinese hotel reviews and finds that ERNIE achieves the highest accu-
racy and F1 score, outperforming BERT-based variants. It highlights 
ERNIE’s strength in capturing semantic nuances, making it effective for 
sentiment analysis in real-world service industries.
The third most cited paper is An ERNIE-based joint model for Chinese 
named entity recognition, with 31 citations. Wang et al. (2020a) proposed 
ERNIE-Joint, a Chinese named entity recognition model that integrates 
both token-level and sentence-level features. By introducing an auxiliary 
task of entity count prediction, the model enhances contextual under-
standing. It achieved strong performance on MSRA and Weibo datasets, 
with an F1 score of up to 94.20 %, outperforming both BERT and the 
original ERNIE. This study represents an early and influential applica-
tion of ERNIE in Chinese information extraction tasks.
These highly cited works reveal ERNIE is widely recognized for its 
strength in Chinese-specific NLP tasks, particularly where semantic 
depth and contextual richness are critical. It is increasingly positioned 
within a global comparative discourse, not just as a model, but as a 
technopolitical artifact. Despite high interest, empirical access and 
transparency issues have constrained its broader international testing. 
RQ2e: What methods or research designs are most commonly used in 
the analyzed studies?
An analysis of the research methods employed across 147 peer- 
reviewed journal articles on ERNIE reserach, published between 2019 
and May 2025, reveals a pronounced methodological preference for 
quantitative approaches. As shown in Fig. 12, out of the total corpus, 
116 studies (79 %) adopted quantitative designs, while only a limited 
proportion employed qualitative (3 articles, 2 %) or theoretical (4 arti-
cles, 2.7 %) approaches. Additionally, 17 studies (12 %) utilized mixed 
methods, and 5 studies (3.4 %) were categorized as design-based 
research. The predominance of quantitative methodologies aligns with 
ERNIE’s development as a language model rooted in computational 
linguistics and artificial intelligence. Most studies in this category 
implemented experimental evaluation frameworks, employing perfor-
mance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and BLEU scores across 
benchmark datasets (Wang et al., 2020a; Wen et al., 2023). 
Mixed-method studies often combined computational experiments with 
discourse or content analysis to explore interpretive dimensions, 
particularly in education and ethics-related contexts (Wei et al., 2025; 
Xiao et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025). Design-based research, though less 
common, appeared in studies aiming to construct ERNIE-integrated 
instructional platforms or intelligent tutoring systems (Leng et al., 
2024; Li & Tarp, 2024). Notably, purely qualitative or theoretical studies 
remain rare, indicating a significant methodological gap in reflective, 
interpretive, or ethnographic engagement with ERNIE Bot’s use in 
real-world educational or communicative contexts. This quantitative 
dominance also suggests an opportunity for future research to incor-
porate more critical, sociocultural, or human-centered methodological 
frameworks to address ERNIE Bot’s impact beyond technical 
performance.
4.1.3. RO3: To establish a baseline understanding of the existing body of 
knowledge related to ERNIE bot as an educational tool
To address this objective, the following questions are explored. 
RQ3: What is the status of research on ERNIE Bot in education and 
how has it evolved over the past 2 years?
Among the 147 studies identified in the scientometric analysis, 33 
(22.4 %) focus partially or primarily on ERNIE Bot’s educational po-
tentials. This indicates a notable level of scholarly interest, particularly 
considering that ERNIE Bot was only released to the public in 2023, 
education-related ERNIE studies began to cluster in significant volume 
only after 2024. Only 1 article was published in 2023, 15 in 2024, and 
17 in 2025, coinciding with the release of ERNIE 4.0 and subsequent 
open access to Chinese users. This temporal pattern reflects broader 
dynamics in AI diffusion, where technical maturity often precedes

educational implementation. Compared to more established LLMs like 
Chat GPT, which dominate discussions in AI-enhanced pedagogy 
(Rudolph et al., 2023; Wangsa et al., 2024), ERNIE Bot’s educational 
footprint remains modest but promising. Clusters of keyword 
co-occurrence network visualization (Fig. 7) shows that educationally 
relevant keywords such as “human”, “controlled study”, “language”, and 
“large language model”, increasingly co-occur with ERNIE across recent 
studies. These terms are predominantly found in Cluster 2 of the 
keyword co-occurrence network, which encapsulates applied and 
human-centered research directions. The ERNIE model exhibits sub-
stantial application potential across multiple domains related to 
Chinese-language education and training. Its strengths are particularly 
evident in tasks involving Chinese language processing, integration with 
knowledge graphs for enhanced understanding and generation, as well 
as its notable performance in specific standardized assessments and 
domain-specific applications (Cao et al., 2025; Che et al., 2024; Fan & 
Chen, 2024; Guo et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024, 2025; 
Zhou et al., 2024). ERNIE Bot has been employed as an assistive tool to 
support curriculum development, facilitate personalized learning ex-
periences, improve automated writing feedback, assist in professional 
training and examinations, generate instructional materials, and analyze 
learner behaviors (Guo et al., 2025; Li et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2024; Yang 
et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2024). Nevertheless, its performance is not 
consistently superior across all tasks and benchmarks. Limitations 
remain in certain evaluation dimensions, and in some cases, it under-
performs compared to human experts such as physicians or educators. 
Moreover, human oversight is often necessary to ensure the accuracy, 
reliability, and safety of its outputs (Cao et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025; He 
et al., 2024; Othman et al., 2024; Wen et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025). For 
non-Chinese users, limited accessibility and language-specific optimi-
zation may also pose constraints to broader adoption (Guo et al., 2025; 
Rudolph et al., 2023).
From a methodological perspective, the educational literature on 
ERNIE Bot is marked by a strong emphasis on mixed-method and 
experimental research designs. More than half of the empirical studies 
employ quantitative validation often using precision, recall, and F1 
metrics to assess model performance in classification or interaction 
tasks. Other integrate user feedback, interviews, or discourse surveys to 
gauge instructional effectiveness and learner trust. For example, studies 
in clinical and nursing education explore how ERNIE-generated feed-
back aligns with human tutor expectations (He et al., 2024),while others 
in the sentiment analysis domain report on ERNIE’s ability to distinguish 
between affective and cognitive responses among learners (Xiao et al., 
2024; Zhou et al., 2024).
In summary, although ERNIE Bot remains underrepresented in 
global educational AI research compared to Western LLMs, the existing 
body of literature demonstrates clear growth, methodological diversity, 
and thematic relevance. ERNIE’s trajectory from a linguistically 
grounded language model to an educational tool used in affective 
computing, nationalism education, and instructional benchmarking re-
veals the convergence of technical innovation and pedagogical adapta-
tion. These patterns set the stage for a closer examination of the 
discursive and ideological dimensions of ERNIE Bot’s educational role, 
which we will explore in the following section.
4.2. Discourse analysis
4.2.1. Discourse analysis framework and procedure
To systematically examine how ERNIE Bot is linguistically con-
structed and ideologically positioned in academic research, this study 
employed a multi-layered discourse analysis framework tailored for 
large-scale literature synthesis. This analytical strand complements the 
scientometric results by exploring the semantic and rhetorical functions 
embedded in the texts, thereby bridging macro-level publication pat-
terns with micro-level knowledge construction. The analysis covered 
147 peer-reviewed journal articles. Full texts were retrieved and 
subjected to qualitative content analysis, employing an abductive cod-
ing approach (Fairclough, 1992; van Dijk, 1993). Initial categories were 
informed by prior discourse studies in AI and Ed Tech, while additional 
themes emerged inductively from the data corpus. The analysis focused 
on two major discourse analysis:
Discourse Analysis 1: To investigate how ERNIE Bot is framed as a 
generative AI technology and how researchers position themselves and 
their work within this field. This goal examined both descriptive rep-
resentations of ERNIE, such as “Chinese counterpart to Chat GPT”, 
“semantically enhanced model”, or “nationally competitive tool” and 
the discursive positioning strategies employed by researchers. Includes 
mappings of institutional affiliations, funding bodies, geopolitical 
framing, and rhetorical practices such as performance benchmarking, 
figure-based authority claims, and comparative tables. Furthermore, the 
goal explores how methodologies (e.g., empirical evaluation, ablation 
testing, language-specific adaptation) are embedded into discourse as 
markers of credibility and expertise. Table 10 provides illustrative ex-
amples highlighting how ERNIE is constructed, the power structures 
underlying the texts, and the rhetorical strategies used to assert rele-
vance and legitimacy in the field.
Discourse Analysis 2:specifically analyzed how ERNIE is constructed 
within educational discourse. This included analysis of tool-related 
framing (e.g., intelligent feedback system, essay scorer), and role posi-
tioning of teachers and learners. As shown in Table 11, teacher roles 
ranged from integrators to pedagogical gatekeepers, while learners were 
either passive recipients or active co-constructors of AI-mediated 
learning.
Each theme was coded into a structured Excel matrix and triangu-
lated with metadata such as publication year, research method, and 
cluster membership from VOSviewer. This enabled both thematic satu-
ration and alignment with quantitative insights. This integrated 
approach offers a replicable model for discourse analysis in AI-related 
scientometric studies. It not only reveals what is said about ERNIE 
Bot, but also how, by whom, and under what institutional logics. The 
triadic goals enable the mapping of both textual meaning and researcher 
positioning, contributing to a deeper understanding of knowledge pro-
duction hierarchies in the emerging domain of Gen AI in education.
4.2.2. RO4: To examine language use in ERNIE Bot’s publications to 
understand the underlying assumptions and ideologies
Discourse analysis encompasses the use of language to construct 
knowledge, convey meaning, or represent power dynamics within the 
research field. Three questions are addressed as follows. 
RQ4a: How is ‘Gen AI in education’ framed in the literature on ERNIE 
Bot?
Discourse surrounding Gen AI in educational research involving 
ERNIE Bot reflects a multi-layered and culturally contingent narrative. 
Unlike global Anglophone discourse that frequently centers on issues 
such as academic integrity, plagiarism detection, or instructional auto-
mation, the framing of Gen AI in ERNIE-related literature often empha-
sizes contextual alignment, affective engagement, and national 
pedagogical relevance. Analysis of the 33 education-oriented articles 
reveals three dominant discursive framings:
Gen AI as an enhancer of culturally responsive learning: ERNIE Bot is 
frequently situated within a discourse of culturally responsive AI in 
education. Many authors explicitly highlight ERNIE’s linguistic advan-
tage in processing Chinese semantics, idiomatic expressions, and clas-
sical literature, a competence that is rhetorically aligned with national 
educational goals and local curriculum demands (Fan & Chen, 2024; Liu 
et al., 2025). For instance, in nationalism-oriented education studies 
from Indonesia and China, ERNIE Bot is listed alongside tools like 
Chat GPT and Bard, but is distinctly positioned as a vehicle for trans-
mitting local values and civic ideals (Saputra et al., 2024). This framing 
supports the narrative of ERNIE Bot not only as a functional tool but also

as a symbol of epistemic autonomy, capable of supporting educational 
systems that prioritize identity, morality, and tradition.
Gen AI as a socio-emotional support system: A growing number of 
studies employ affective discourses to describe Gen AI’s role in educa-
tional intervention, particularly in areas such as psychological well- 
being, emotional literacy, and human-AI empathy. In these texts, 
ERNIE Bot is not merely depicted as a content generator but as a tool 
capable of recognizing, modeling, and responding to human emotion. 
For example, studies utilizing ERNIE-Tiny combined with Bi GRU 
frameworks focus on sentiment recognition in online reflective mental 
health screening (Che et al., 2024; Xiao et al., 2024). Such discourses 
frame Gen AI as a relational agent, where affective sensitivity and 
socio-emotional awareness become crucial indicators of model ade-
quacy in educational contexts (He et al., 2024; Yang & Liu, 2025). 
Compared to the neutral or transactional tone often found in literature 
on Chat GPT, ERNIE Bot related discourse increasingly uses emotive and 
ethical rhetoric, positioning the model as a psychologically attuned 
facilitator rather than a technical black box.
Gen AI as a sovereign pedagogical actor in a multipolar AI ecosystem: 
ERNIE Bot is often framed as a sovereign AI alternative within educa-
tional discourse (Cao et al., 2025; Xiao et al., 2025). While some studies 
employ comparative rhetoric to evaluate ERNIE Bot alongside Western 
models (e.g., Chat GPT, Bard), these comparisons frequently underscore 
ERNIE Bot’s alignment with regional pedagogical priorities and insti-
tutional mandates (Liu et al., 2025). This is particularly evident in re-
view articles that discuss ERNIE Bot’s deployment in multilingual or 
politically sensitive contexts, where its data sovereignty, ideological 
neutrality, or national policy alignment are framed as strategic advan-
tages. In these texts, the framing of Gen AI in education is infused with 
geopolitical subtext, suggesting that educational technologies are not 
only pedagogical instruments but also sites of soft power contestation. 
Across these framings, a common rhetorical strategy is the emphasis on 
local 
relevance 
and 
human-centric 
integration. 
Unlike 
the 
techno-optimist or techno-critical binaries often observed in Western 
discourse on AI in education, the ERNIE Bot literature reveals a more 
pragmatic and hybrid discourse: one that acknowledges both the 
pedagogical potential and socio-political embeddedness of Gen AI. In 
doing so, it constructs ERNIE Bot as a mediator of educational change a 
Gen AI agent simultaneously shaped by and shaping educational norms, 
values, and practices within specific linguistic-cultural contexts. 
RQ4b: What rhetorical strategies or discursive practices are used by 
the key researchers on ERNIE Bot to position themselves in the field?
In positioning ERNIE Bot within the broader landscape of Gen AI 
research, key authors adopt a range of rhetorical strategies and discur-
sive practices aimed at legitimizing their epistemic authority, advancing 
methodological credibility, and aligning their work with national or 
domain-specific priorities. Analysis of both education-related and 
technical papers reveals that these strategies tend to cluster around three 
interrelated discursive patterns:
Technoscientific rationalization: A dominant rhetorical move is the 
deployment of technoscientific rationalization, wherein authors fore-
ground the architectural novelty, algorithmic efficiency, or domain 
specialization of their ERNIE-based models. This is evident in the 
pervasive use of model descriptors such as “semantic enhancement,” 
“multitask pretraining,” and “entity-level masking” (e.g., Wang et al., 
2023; Zhang et al., 2023). These phrases not only situate ERNIE within 
the lineage of pre-trained language models (often in contrast with BERT 
or GPT models), but also underscore its alignment with scientific rigor 
and innovation. In several studies, particularly those involving educa-
tion and public service applications, researchers emphasize ERNIE’s 
compatibility with specialized tasks like text classification, emotional 
prediction, or relation extraction (He et al., 2024; Hsieh & Zeng, 2022). 
Such technical specificity operates as a rhetorical device to reinforce 
methodological sophistication and model superiority.
Visualized benchmarking and performative comparison: Visualiza-
tion and benchmarking serve as key discursive tools in constructing 
ERNIE Bot’s legitimacy. Across the reviewed literature, the use of 
architectural diagrams, performance charts, radar plots, and ablation 
tables is widespread. For example, visual artifacts in multiple studies not 
only depict the flow of ERNIE Bot enhanced pipelines but also position 
the model as central to performance improvements over baselines (e.g., 
ERNIE vs. BERT/Ro BERTa comparisons). These visuals often function 
less as illustrations and more as performative evidence, reinforcing 
claims of superiority and innovation. In educational studies, particularly 
those with comparative focus (e.g., Rudolph et al., 2023; Saputra et al., 
2024), tables juxtaposing Chat GPT, Bard, and ERNIE offer a visual 
rhetoric of parity or complementarity. This benchmarking strategy 
implicitly positions authors as evaluators with transnational AI literacy 
and cross-platform expertise.
Institutional anchoring and policy alignment: Many researchers 
engage in institutional and geopolitical positioning to align their studies 
with national research priorities or regional strategic interests. The au-
thors frequently refer to their affiliation with elite institutions, national 
key laboratories, or government-funded research programs (e.g., Na-
tional Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research 
Funds for the Central Universities). In some cases, such as studies orig-
inating from Anhui Medical University, Tsinghua University, or Chinese 
Academy of Sciences, authors leverage these institutional affiliations to 
emphasize their authority in advancing AI for national good. This 
positioning is not merely logistical but deeply rhetorical, it frames 
ERNIE Bot research as serving sovereign knowledge production, capable 
of providing alternatives to Anglophone-dominated AI ecologies.
Collectively, these rhetorical strategies construct ERNIE Bot research 
as a scientifically legitimate, visually validated, and politically relevant 
domain of inquiry. They help researchers assert not only the technical 
validity of ERNIE Bot but also their discursive legitimacy within both 
national and global AI communities. More subtly, these practices illus-
trate how academic knowledge production is entangled with broader 
forces (visual aesthetics, funding infrastructures, and geopolitical 
imaginaries) that shape what counts as credible, useful, or advanced in 
the field of Gen AI. 
RQ4c: What are the power relations and knowledge hierarchies 
evident in the discourse on ERNIE Bot?
The discourse on ERNIE Bot, especially in the context of its educa-
tional applications, reveals a complex interplay of institutional author-
ity, regional epistemologies, and disciplinary hierarchies. Embedded in 
the way researchers describe, apply, and evaluate ERNIE are implicit 
and explicit power dynamics that both reflect and reproduce global in-
equities in AI knowledge production. These dynamics manifest across 
three major domains:
National research sovereignty and state-backed legitimacy: A 
recurring feature across ERNIE Bot research is the concentration of 
epistemic authority within Chinese state-aligned academic and corpo-
rate institutions. Analysis of the authorship and funding networks in-
dicates that a significant proportion of high-impact publications 
originate from elite universities (e.g., Tsinghua University, University of 
Chinese Academy of Sciences), national laboratories, and Baidu- 
affiliated research teams. These institutions often co-author papers 
with government support through major grant programs like the Na-
tional Natural Science Foundation of China or the National Key R&D 
Program. In discourse terms, these affiliations are not neutrally stated 
but are foregrounded as markers of credibility and strategic alignment. 
Such framing constructs ERNIE Bot not simply as a technical artifact but 
as a state-sanctioned epistemic project, situated within China’s broader 
ambition for AI leadership and technological sovereignty.
Asymmetries in comparative discourse with Western LLMs: 
Comparative discourses with Anglophone LLMs such as Chat GPT, Bard, 
or Claude reveal underlying knowledge hierarchies that reflect the

global center-periphery divide. In many review studies, ERNIE is posi-
tioned defensively, described as “lagging behind” in general-purpose 
capabilities, “restricted by data access and censorship”, or “less open 
and verifiable” due to national infrastructure limitations. Even in texts 
that affirm ERNIE’s cultural specificity or semantic depth in Chinese, 
there remains an implicit deference to Western benchmarks, particularly 
regarding performance metrics, publication visibility, or tool interop-
erability. These rhetorical moves reinforce a hierarchized epistemology 
where knowledge produced in English-speaking academic hubs remains 
the default standard, and models like ERNIE are judged through exter-
nally defined criteria, even when these criteria are culturally mis-
matched or politically loaded.
Hierarchical gatekeeping of educational knowledge domains: 
Several studies attempt to invert or localize these hierarchies by 
invoking the concept of “contextual intelligence” or “regional rele-
vance.” In these narratives, ERNIE Bot’s strength lies precisely in its non- 
Western design: its alignment with Chinese curricula, its ability to pro-
cess classical texts, and its embeddedness in culturally sensitive tasks (e. 
g., Wei, 2024). These arguments position ERNIE Bot not just as a tech-
nically valid model, but as a culturally sovereign alternative to episte-
mically dominant but culturally distant tools like Chat GPT. This 
discursive shift hints at a form of local models are valued not by their 
mimicry of Western norms, but by their ability to serve local epistemic 
needs and pedagogical traditions.
Finally, within the educational domain, power hierarchies are also 
evident in how teachers, students, and institutional actors are repre-
sented. In most studies, ERNIE Bot is framed as a top-down tool for 
enhancing instructional delivery, automating feedback, or monitoring 
sentiment, rarely as a medium for co-constructing knowledge with 
learners or fostering epistemic agency among teachers. This reflects a 
broader instrumentalist view of education, where technology is a means 
of optimizing efficiency rather than transforming relationships of 
knowledge and power. While a few studies begin to explore learner 
experience or emotional engagement, there is limited discourse on how 
Gen AI reshapes educational power dynamics between institutions and 
individuals, or how it may embed structural biases and surveillance into 
pedagogical systems.
In conclusion, the discourse surrounding ERNIE Bot is shaped by 
national aspirations and an emerging counter-narrative of contextual-
ized legitimacy. These patterns reveal not only the geopolitics of AI 
research but also the epistemic assumptions that underpin what is 
considered valid, useful, or advanced in Gen AI-enhanced education. As 
ERNIE Bot continues to evolve and expand into international research 
conversations, critically interrogating these discursive formations will 
be essential to ensuring that educational technologies serve diverse 
learners without reinforcing inherited hierarchies.
4.2.3. RO5: To identify the potentials of ERNIE in education and 
opportunities for further research and exploration
Identifying ERNIE’s educational potential and opportunities for 
further research and exploration requires exploring three areas. 
RQ5a: How is the role of teachers or instructional facilitators rep-
resented in the discourse on ERNIE Bot?
The role of teachers and instructional facilitators in ERNIE Bot 
related educational discourse is, at present, underdeveloped and func-
tionally constrained, reflecting broader tensions in how AI is integrated 
into pedagogical systems. Across the 33 education-oriented studies 
analyzed, few texts explicitly center the teacher as a key stakeholder in 
Gen AI adoption. Instead, educators are often portrayed in instrumental 
or backgrounded roles, either as passive recipients of AI-generated 
outputs or as system supervisors validating model performance rather 
than as co-creators, ethical mediators, or pedagogical designers. In many 
empirical studies, ERNIE Bot is positioned as a tool for instructional 
enhancement, particularly through automating tasks such as feedback 
generation, sentiment analysis of student writing, and personalized 
question-answering. These tasks are frequently described in terms of 
“relieving teacher workload” or “replacing repetitive functions” (He 
et al., 2024; Hsieh & Zeng, 2022). While this discourse supports the 
narrative of efficiency and scalability, it also subtly constructs educators 
as logistical managers rather than epistemic agents, relegated to over-
seeing and monitoring rather than shaping instructional design in 
partnership with AI systems. In a smaller subset of studies, particularly 
those dealing with curriculum-level planning or civic education (e.g., 
Saputra et al., 2024), teachers are positioned within a broader peda-
gogical ecosystem involving AI-enhanced personalization. However, 
even in these cases, the role of the teacher is often abstracted and 
generalized, with limited attention to how AI tools like ERNIE Bot might 
affect classroom dynamics, teacher identity, or instructional autonomy. 
There is a notable absence of grounded, ethnographic, or 
teacher-voice-driven perspectives, which could offer richer insights into 
how educators interpret, negotiate, or resist the integration of ERNIE 
into their practices. Moreover, the language used to describe teacher-AI 
interaction is often technocratic rather than pedagogical. Terms such as 
“fine-tuning feedback pipelines”, “verifying AI suggestions”, or “moni-
toring AI-assisted outputs” dominate the discourse, suggesting a shift 
toward technological gatekeeping rather than dialogic pedagogy. This 
aligns with concerns raised in broader Gen AI literature, where teacher 
agency is often sacrificed at the altar of algorithmic optimization 
(Grassini, 2023; Lo et al., 2024).
In addition, few studies engage with the professional development 
needs of teachers expected to use ERNIE Bot in educational contexts. 
There is limited discussion of training, ethical considerations, or scaf-
folding frameworks that could support educators in making informed, 
critical, and pedagogically sound decisions when using Gen AI. This la-
cuna suggests a persistent assumption that technological proficiency is 
neutral and self-evident, ignoring the socio-cultural and institutional 
support structures necessary for meaningful adoption. Nevertheless, 
some emerging discourses point toward more relational and collabora-
tive models. A handful of recent studies in nursing and clinical education 
explore how teachers can integrate ERNIE-generated content into 
personalized instruction, reflecting a tentative shift toward blended 
human-AI instructional design (Cao et al., 2025). However, these ex-
amples remain the exception rather than the rule.
In sum, while ERNIE Bot is increasingly present in educational 
research, the teacher’s voice is conspicuously muted. The dominant 
discourse frames educators as operational intermediaries rather than 
pedagogical collaborators, reflecting a broader epistemic bias in AI-in- 
education literature. Future studies must move beyond instrumental 
logics and begin to critically engage with how Gen AI reshapes teacher 
agency, pedagogical values, and relational dynamics in diverse educa-
tional settings. Doing so will not only enrich our understanding of ERNIE 
Bot’s educational potential but also ensure that AI integration is guided 
by human-centered and contextually responsive educational design. 
RQ5b: What are the gaps in knowledge and the potential of ERNIE 
Bot as an educational tool?
Despite the growing body of literature exploring ERNIE Bot’s tech-
nical architecture and applied performance, significant knowledge gaps 
remain regarding its pedagogical integration, learner impact, and long- 
term implications for educational systems. Existing studies highlight 
ERNIE Bot’s linguistic strengths, particularly in Chinese semantic pro-
cessing, domain-specific reasoning, and sentiment analysis, but tend to 
emphasize performance optimization over pedagogical theorization, 
revealing a persistent disconnect between AI development and educa-
tional science.
One major gap concerns the absence of robust pedagogical frame-
works guiding the deployment of ERNIE Bot in classrooms. Most studies 
adopt an experimental or engineering perspective, focusing on accuracy, 
recall, or F1 scores to evaluate ERNIE-enhanced tasks (e.g., text 
Y. Yan et al.

classification, question answering), while neglecting theories of 
learning, motivation, or socio-cognitive development. There is limited 
engagement with established educational paradigms such as construc-
tivism, connectivism, or culturally responsive pedagogy that could 
contextualize ERNIE Bot’s role in shaping how learners acquire, nego-
tiate, and apply knowledge. This renders the model pedagogically 
under-theorized, 
despite 
its 
increasing 
presence 
in 
learning 
environments.
A second area of under-exploration involves learner agency and 
student experience. Few empirical studies assess how students interact 
with ERNIE Bot-powered tools, how they perceive the AI’s feedback, or 
how its use influences their cognitive engagement, self-regulation, or 
epistemic trust. This is particularly problematic in emotionally charged 
contexts such as language learning, writing development, or affective 
computing, where ERNIE is often applied without adequate reflection on 
how learners interpret, internalize, or contest the AI-generated re-
sponses. In comparison, studies on Chat GPT increasingly include user 
experience, reflective diaries, and student interviews, approaches 
largely absent from ERNIE Bot-focused education research.
Moreover, there is a lack of longitudinal research evaluating ERNIE 
Bot’s sustained impact over time, whether in terms of student learning 
gains, institutional adoption, or equity outcomes. Given the platform’s 
evolving architecture and expanding feature set (e.g., ERNIE Bot 4.5 
Turbo and X1 Turbo, Kunlun chips), more attention is needed to trace 
how iterative improvements translate into educational value, and 
whether they mitigate or amplify existing inequalities in access, lan-
guage privilege, and cultural representation.
At the same time, the reviewed literature reveals several promising 
directions for ERNIE Bot’s educational potential. 
• Localized content delivery and semantic alignment: ERNIE Bot’s 
optimization for Chinese texts makes it a powerful tool for support-
ing Mandarin-medium education, particularly in subjects such as 
classical literature, history, and ethics, where linguistic and cultural 
nuance is critical.
• Emotional intelligence and affective computing: In mental health 
education, ERNIE Bot has demonstrated potential in detecting and 
responding to student sentiment, offering personalized emotional 
feedback and early intervention possibilities.
• Multimodal learning platforms: ERNIE Bot has been integrated into 
applications combining text, image, and audio inputs an underex-
plored yet promising space for adaptive learning systems, particu-
larly in inclusive or accessibility-focused education.
• Teacher support and automation: Although under-theorized (as dis-
cussed in RQ5a), ERNIE Bot’s capabilities in generating quizzes, 
summaries, and grading rubrics suggest strong potential in reducing 
teacher burden and enabling instructional personalization at scale.
To unlock these potentials, future research must bridge the gap be-
tween computational performance and educational meaning-making. 
This includes incorporating interdisciplinary frameworks, foreground-
ing learner perspectives, and fostering critical inquiry into the socio-
technical systems that shape how ERNIE Bot functions in real 
classrooms. Without such efforts, ERNIE Bot risks remaining a techno-
logical artifact evaluated by engineers rather than a genuinely peda-
gogical tool co-constructed by educators, students, and designers. 
RQ5c: What are the potential future research directions about ERNIE 
Bot in education?
Building upon the gaps identified in current ERNIE Bot related 
educational research, future investigations must move toward integra-
tive, critical, and context-sensitive directions that deepen our under-
standing of how LLMs like ERNIE Bot can reshape teaching, learning, 
and educational systems. These directions should go beyond perfor-
mance benchmarking and seek to situate ERNIE Bot within broader 
epistemic, pedagogical, and sociotechnical frameworks. Based on the 
current corpus and emerging themes, several promising research tra-
jectories can be articulated. These gaps have been grouped into 4 key 
areas in Fig. 13 to provide clarity regarding future research directions. 
i Technical Gaps (including benchmarking ERNIE’s performance 
against international LLMs in educational NLP tasks): Future 
research should assess the effectiveness, scalability, and ethical di-
mensions of such integrations, and consider how AI-driven adap-
tivity aligns (or conflicts) with existing instructional philosophies. 
This type of integration can further be explored to power the 
comparative evaluation of ERNIE Bot’s potential to demonstrate 
higher contextual capabilities in comparison with non-Chinese LLMs. 
This is an important area of study especially considering the pro-
motion of ERNIE Bot’s contextual awareness as a basis for its supe-
riority to a global tool like Chat GPT. There is a further opportunity to 
examine ERNIE Bot as a value-laden epistemic actor, particularly in 
the way it mediates knowledge legitimation, citation authority, and 
content reliability. Scholars can build on discourse analysis methods 
(as applied in RQ4) to explore how ERNIE Bot-augmented systems 
reproduce or challenge dominant knowledge hierarchies, whether 
through answer generation, topic framing, or historical representa-
tion. This line of research is particularly relevant in cross-cultural 
educational contexts, where AI-generated outputs intersect with 
national curricula, ideological narratives, or textbook standards.
ii Pedagogical Directions (such as its integration into classroom 
practice, adaptive learning systems, and emotional intelligence 
modeling): There is a pressing need for teacher-centered design 
research that explores how educators interpret, adapt, and negotiate 
ERNIE Bot in their pedagogical practices. As shown in RQ5a, 
teachers are often discursively marginalized or operationalized in 
current literature. Future studies should employ ethnographic, 
participatory design, or co-creation methodologies to center the 
professional voices of instructors, especially in curriculum co-design, 
prompt engineering, and classroom governance. Such inquiry could 
inform the development of AI-pedagogy interfaces that reflect edu-
cators’ practical constraints, value systems, and cultural commit-
ments. Future research should pursue student experience and learner 
agency studies, particularly in longitudinal formats. These may 
include diary studies, interaction logs, critical incident interviews, 
and affective trajectory mapping to better understand how learners 
perceive, trust, resist, or depend on ERNIE Bot across different 
learning contexts. Specific attention should be paid to metacognitive 
shifts, academic identity formation, and the ways ERNIE Bot may 
reinforce or challenge learners’ epistemic beliefs, especially in high- 
stakes or culturally sensitive domains like language learning, civics, 
and moral reasoning. Finally, ERNIE Bot’s potential in adaptive 
learning and multimodal education remains underexplored and 
technologically promising. With its integration into platforms 
capable of processing image, audio, and structured data (via Kunlun 
hardware and Baidu’s content ecosystem), ERNIE Bot could support 
personalized and multimodal instruction—for example, in STEAM 
education, special education, or transmedia storytelling.
iii Contextual and Ethical Gaps (including transparency, censorship, 
and data bias concerns in localized deployments): Exploration of 
equity, inclusion, and accessibility dimensions of ERNIE Bot 
deployment is another dimension of focus for future studies. Given 
that the model is optimized for Mandarin Chinese and deeply 
embedded in China’s sociotechnical infrastructure, researchers must 
interrogate how its deployment impacts minoritized language 
speakers, rural learners, or students with disabilities. Comparative 
studies across linguistic, regional, and socioeconomic lines will be 
critical in evaluating whether ERNIE Bot can democratize or delimit 
access to educational resources, and what forms of cultural or po-
litical exclusion may persist in its training data and outputs.
Y. Yan et al.

iv Methodological Gaps: The need for longitudinal studies, student- 
centered evaluations, and interdisciplinary collaborations to bridge 
AI, education, and sociocultural research also stands out as a po-
tential focus of future studies. The application of novel tools designed 
specifically to support bibliometric analysis (e.g. database merging 
and deduplication, AI-powered search and bibliometric exclusion 
tools, etc.) also emerge as a potential focus of future studies. Their 
impact on review output and findings can contribute to highlighting 
how technology and software are changing the SLR landscape or 
improving the robustness of findings.
Collectively, these research directions underscore the need for a 
paradigm shift in ERNIE Bot from isolated technical validation to crit-
ical, participatory, and pedagogically anchored inquiry. As generative 
AI becomes increasingly entangled with educational infrastructures, 
researchers must adopt an interdisciplinary lens that foregrounds 
human-AI collaboration, social equity, and contextual meaning-making. 
Only then can ERNIE Bot be meaningfully understood not just as a 
computational artifact, but as an evolving educational actor situated 
within dynamic systems of teaching and learning.
5. Discussion
This study employed a mixed-method scientometric approach to 
investigate the emerging research landscape of ERNIE Bot, with a spe-
cific focus on its educational applications, epistemic positioning, and 
discourse framings. By synthesizing quantitative bibliometric trends and 
qualitative discourse analyses, several key insights have emerged that 
collectively advance our understanding of ERNIE Bot’s evolving role as a 
culturally situated LLM within global AI and education ecosystems.
The quantitative analysis revealed that research on ERNIE Bot has 
experienced rapid growth since 2023, coinciding with the public release 
of ERNIE 4.0 and its open-access deployment in China. While early 
studies focused primarily on foundational NLP tasks, such as sentiment 
analysis, named entity recognition, and deep learning optimization, 
recent work shows a clear trend toward applied and interdisciplinary 
contexts, especially in education, healthcare, and human-AI interaction. 
Within the education domain, 33 of the 147 analyzed publications (22.4 
%) directly addressed ERNIE Bot’s pedagogical potential. These studies 
concentrated on applications such as emotion-aware tutoring systems, 
personalized feedback delivery, nationalism education, and Chinese- 
language adaptive learning environments. However, while this volume 
suggests growing interest, the analysis also indicates that ERNIE Bot 
remains underrepresented and undertheorized compared to Western 
LLMs like Chat GPT, particularly in global educational research indexed 
outside China.
The discourse analysis exposed a layered and sometimes ambivalent 
representation of ERNIE Bot within the literature. On one hand, ERNIE 
Bot is discursively framed as a symbol of Chinese AI sovereignty, 
frequently praised for its semantic sophistication in Mandarin, cultural 
reasoning capabilities, and alignment with national pedagogical prior-
ities. This framing aligns with Baidu’s strategic narrative and broader 
state-supported discourse on technological independence and epistemic 
localization. On the other hand, comparative discourses often position 
ERNIE Bot defensively in relation to Chat GPT or Bard, highlighting its 
lag in openness, training diversity, and international visibility. This dual 
positioning reveals an underlying knowledge hierarchy wherein West-
ern models serve as the default benchmarks, even in studies that aim to 
challenge their universality. ERNIE Bot’s legitimacy, then, is not purely 
technical,it is also discursively negotiated through geopolitical and

linguistic imaginaries. Crucially, the educational literature on ERNIE 
Bot reflects this tension. While scholars emphasize the model’s appli-
cability in culturally specific educational scenarios (e.g., Chinese 
nationalism education or sentiment-aware language tutoring), they 
often omit sustained engagement with pedagogical theory, learner 
agency, or classroom dynamics. Teachers are rarely framed as co- 
designers or pedagogical decision-makers; instead, they are repre-
sented as implementers or validators of AI-generated content. Similarly, 
students are positioned as passive recipients of model outputs, rather 
than as epistemic agents navigating, interpreting, or challenging AI- 
mediated knowledge.
One of the central contributions of this study is its integration of 
scientometric mapping with discourse analysis to reveal how ERNIE Bot 
is not only used in education but also talked about as a pedagogical tool, 
as a cultural actor, and as an epistemic intervention. The findings sug-
gest that ERNIE Bot’s current educational value lies less in its technical 
distinctiveness and more in its cultural-local specificity, particularly in 
Chinese-medium environments, and in geopolitical contexts where 
Western AI models face infrastructural or ideological limitations. Yet, 
this strength also signals a limitation. Most current research adopts a 
technocentric and utilitarian view of ERNIE Bot in education, with little 
attention to affective, ethical, or relational dimensions of learning. 
There is limited empirical data on how students and teachers actually 
interact with ERNIE Bot-powered systems in real-life educational set-
tings. Moreover, the field lacks robust interdisciplinary frameworks that 
connect ERNIE Bot’s capabilities with well-established educational 
theories such as constructivism, culturally responsive pedagogy, or 
transformative learning.
The findings point to several directions for advancing ERNIE Bot- 
based educational research. First, future work should foreground 
teacher and student agency, not only in usage but in design and adap-
tation. This means moving from “how ERNIE Bot performs” to “how 
learners and educators shape what ERNIE Bot becomes” in situated 
learning contexts. Second, researchers should explore critical perspec-
tives on knowledge hierarchies, including how ERNIE Bot may repro-
duce or resist dominant epistemologies. Third, there is potential for 
ERNIE Bot to contribute to adaptive and multimodal education, espe-
cially when integrated with speech, visual, or social media data in in-
clusive learning environments.
Finally, this study underscores the importance of a broader educa-
tional turn in AI research, one that treats education not merely as an 
application domain but as a normative space where technologies are 
evaluated based on how they support diverse, equitable, and meaningful 
human learning. ERNIE Bot’s future in education will not be determined 
solely by performance metrics, but by how it is discursively and mate-
rially embedded in pedagogical relationships, cultural systems, and 
epistemic communities.
6. Conclusion
This study provided a comprehensive scientometric and discourse- 
analytic exploration of ERNIE Bot’s emergence as an educational tool 
within the broader landscape of generative AI research. Situated at the 
intersection of NLP, educational technology, and global epistemic poli-
tics, ERNIE Bot represents a unique case of a non-Western, culturally 
grounded LLM that is gradually being positioned for pedagogical use 
across diverse learning environments. By employing a mixed-method 
approach combining bibliometric mapping (via Cite Space and VOS-
viewer) with critical discourse analysis, this study generated novel in-
sights into both what is being researched about ERNIE Bot and how 
ERNIE Bot is being talked about in the academic literature. Quantita-
tively, we identified a steady rise in ERNIE-focused publications, 
particularly since 2023, with 22.4 % of these studies related to educa-
tion. Thematically, the literature clustered around two major poles: 
technical optimization (e.g., deep learning, semantics, named entity 
recognition) and applied domains such as education and healthcare. 
Research output remains geographically concentrated, with China 
leading both in volume and funding, while international engagement is 
still limited and often evaluative rather than collaborative. Qualita-
tively, the discourse analysis revealed that ERNIE Bot is framed through 
a variety of lenses, as a symbol of national technological leadership, a 
linguistically superior tool for Chinese language contexts, and, increas-
ingly, as a pedagogical agent. However, these framings also reflect 
deeper tensions: ERNIE Bot is often compared unfavorably to Western 
LLMs like Chat GPT, and educational discourse tends to marginalize the 
roles of teachers and learners, emphasizing automation and optimiza-
tion over relational and ethical considerations. Knowledge hierarchies 
persist in the way ERNIE Bot is benchmarked, narrated, and legitimized 
within global research conversations.
The study contributes to the growing field of AI-in-education 
research by offering one of the first systematic mappings of ERNIE 
Bot’s scholarly footprint and by critically interrogating the power re-
lations, institutional structures, and ideological assumptions embedded 
in its academic treatment. It calls for a shift from viewing ERNIE Bot 
merely as a performant NLP tool toward understanding it as a socio- 
technical system that reflects and reshapes educational values, dis-
courses, and practices. Future research should move beyond experi-
mental metrics and engage with how ERNIE Bot is integrated into 
classrooms, interpreted by students, and co-adapted by teachers.
Attention must also be paid to equity, multilingualism, and cultural 
specificity, ensuring that ERNIE Bot’s integration into education sup-
ports not only local relevance but also inclusive, ethical, and learner- 
centered pedagogical transformation.
Furthermore, this study explored the Scopus as a multi-database 
platform, offering a large abstract and citation database for peer- 
reviewed literature including the Wo S, MEDLINE and other core data-
bases and covering a broad spectrum of disciplines, including science, 
technology, medicine, social sciences, and arts and humanities. While 
Scopus is known for its depth and breadth of content, comparing its 
capability with output from tools offering multi-database integration 
and deduplication (e.g. KKU-Biblio Merge, Rayyan, Covidence, etc.).
In sum, ERNIE Bot holds significant yet under-realized potential as 
an educational technology. Its trajectory both in research and in practice 
will depend not only on continued technical advancement, but on the 
theoretical, pedagogical, and critical frameworks that scholars, educa-
tors, and policymakers choose to bring to its development and 
deployment.
7. Limitation
While this study provides a comprehensive scientometric and 
discourse analysis of ERNIE Bot-related research, several limitations 
must be acknowledged. First, the corpus analyzed was limited to peer- 
reviewed journal articles and review papers published in English and 
indexed in the Scopus database. This language restriction may have 
excluded high-quality work published in Chinese or other non-English 
venues, particularly given ERNIE Bot’s origin and deployment context 
in China. Consequently, the findings may not fully capture the breadth 
of domestic Chinese-language scholarship or grey literature, including 
white papers and industrial reports. Second, conference proceedings, 
preprints, and book chapters were excluded from this analysis. Given 
that AI research especially developments around LLMs often emerges 
first in conference formats or open-access preprints, this may have led to 
the omission of cutting-edge but not yet peer-reviewed insights. This 
decision was made to ensure data quality and analytical comparability 
but may limit timeliness. Third, the study’s scientometric patterns were 
shaped significantly by Chinese institutions and funding bodies, which 
dominated authorship, collaboration networks, and citations. While this 
accurately reflects the current state of ERNIE-related research, it may 
introduce regional epistemic bias, particularly in how innovation,

such as those from underrepresented Global South contexts or educators 
not embedded in AI research cultures. Finally, while the mixed-method 
approach allows for both quantitative and qualitative insight, it relies on 
manual discourse coding, which despite careful calibration remains 
interpretive. Although triangulation with scientometric clusters en-
hances reliability, future research could integrate computational lin-
guistics tools (e.g., topic modeling or sentiment analysis) to scale 
discourse analysis across larger datasets with greater reproducibility.
