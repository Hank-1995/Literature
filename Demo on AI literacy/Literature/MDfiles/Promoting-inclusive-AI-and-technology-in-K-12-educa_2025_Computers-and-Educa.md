As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into K–12 education, concerns about equity and 
access have grown. This scoping review explores how inclusive AI curricula are designed, implemented, and 
evaluated in educational settings. Guided by three research questions, we analyzed 17 empirical studies pub-
lished between 2013 and 2024, focusing on (1) the contexts and characteristics of inclusive AI curricula, (2) 
instructional strategies that promote broader participation, and (3) learning outcomes associated with these 
approaches. The findings reveal five key instructional principles (identity, technology, design, content devel-
opment, and sense of belonging) alongside cognitive and affective learning outcomes such as improved content 
knowledge, confidence, and collaboration skills. However, the review also identified gaps in access, alignment 
with standards, and the consistent reporting of learning outcomes. This study offers a synthesized framework to 
guide educators and researchers in designing inclusive, equitable, and pedagogically sound AI-integrated 
learning experiences for diverse student populations.
1. Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping education, trans-
forming how students learn, how teachers teach, and how learning ex-
periences are designed to prepare learners for an increasingly automated 
and data-driven world. As AI becomes more deeply integrated into 
educational settings, there is growing urgency to ensure that all stu-
dents, not just those with access and privilege, can benefit from these 
advances. AI’s potential to personalize learning, support complex 
problem-solving, and enhance engagement has positioned it as a 
powerful educational tool. However, alongside this promise is a growing 
concern that AI may inadvertently widen existing opportunity gaps if 
issues of equity and inclusion are not explicitly addressed (Luckin & 
Holmes, 2016; Pedr´o et al., 2019).
Numerous studies have highlighted the importance of ensuring 
equitable access to AI-enhanced education. For instance, Pedr´o and 
colleagues (2019) identified six key challenges in implementing AI in 
schools, one of which is ensuring inclusion and equity. Students from 
more privileged backgrounds are often better positioned to take 
advantage of new AI-powered learning tools, potentially exacerbating 
disparities in academic achievement. Socioeconomic and cultural 
contexts play a significant role in shaping students’ engagement with AI. 
Druga et al. (2019) found that students’ perceptions and knowledge of 
AI were directly influenced by their social and cultural backgrounds, 
which may lead to uneven learning experiences and missed opportu-
nities for some learners.
Inclusion is understood as the intentional design of learning envi-
ronments, curricula, and instructional practices that enable all students 
to engage meaningfully and benefit from instruction, with particular 
attention to removing barriers related to ability, identity, and access 
(Florian & Black-Hawkins, 2011). Equity in education focuses on 
ensuring fair opportunities and outcomes for all learners, rather than 
equal inputs. Levinson et al. (2022) illustrates how equity involves 
addressing systemic barriers, not simply providing identical resources, 
which often perpetuate existing disparities. The National Research 
Council (2012) underscores that “the most pressing challenge facing U. 
S. education is to provide all students with a fair opportunity to learn” 
(p. 282). Global educational frameworks also stress these priorities. The 
World Inequality Database on Education (WIDE) notes that income, 
gender, and ethnicity significantly influence educational opportunities 
(UNESCO, 2023). Similarly, UNESCO (2018) emphasizes the importance 
of equitable and inclusive quality education for children from poor

households, indigenous and minority groups, and across genders. In 
computing education specifically, socioeconomic status, gender, and 
ethnicity are consistently recognized as dimensions along which stu-
dents are underrepresented (Beyer, 2014; Chklovski et al., 2019; Lee 
et al., 2023; Shams et al., 2023; Whitcomb et al., 2021). These defini-
tions and categorizations are used in this review to frame how the 
analyzed studies approached AI curricula and instructional strategies 
aimed at fostering participation from a broad range of learners.
1.1. Research gap and aim
Although AI holds the potential to unlock innovative learning op-
portunities, it also poses risks as a disruptive technology that could 
reinforce existing societal divides. Underserved and disadvantaged 
populations are particularly vulnerable to being excluded from the 
benefits of AI-integrated learning. To foster broader and more equitable 
student participation, it is critical to adopt instructional strategies and 
pedagogical frameworks that intentionally prioritize inclusivity. While 
interest in AI education has grown substantially, there remains a sig-
nificant gap in AI initiative research that explicitly addresses issues of 
inclusion and diversity in education (Xia et al., 2022).
Existing review studies in the field (e.g., Chen et al., 2020; Zhai et al., 
2021) have primarily examined the general application of AI in educa-
tion, often focusing on the technical dimensions or broad trends, with 
limited attention to underserved or underrepresented student pop-
ulations. Although some reviews, such as Salas-Pilco et al. (2022), have 
explored the strengths and weaknesses of AI in relation to underserved 
students, very few have investigated the instructional strategies and 
pedagogical considerations required to promote inclusive AI education. 
This is a critical gap, as teaching practices and curriculum design play a 
central role in addressing inequities in the classroom. Without inclusive 
teaching frameworks, AI-enhanced education risks serving only a subset 
of students, those who already have access and support.
Given these gaps, there is a clear need to synthesize current knowl-
edge about how inclusive AI curricula are designed, implemented, and 
assessed, particularly in K-12 education. This scoping review aims to 
explore the pedagogical landscape of inclusive AI curricula to better 
understand the strategies used to promote equity and participation 
among underrepresented student groups. Additionally, the review aims 
to analyze the range of student learning outcomes reported in connec-
tion with these strategies. The findings can inform the development of 
practical guidelines for educators, curriculum designers, and policy-
makers committed to inclusive and equitable AI education.
1.2. Research questions
To address these issues and gaps in the literature, our study is 
designed to examine the following research questions: 
RQ1. What descriptive characteristics (e.g., publication year, grade 
level, subject area) are reported in reviewed studies?
RQ2. What instructional strategies and pedagogical considerations 
are used to broaden student participation in inclusive AI and 
technology-enhanced curricula?
RQ3. What are the learning outcomes reported in relation to these 
instructional strategies?
2. Literature review
2.1. Diversity and equity in education
The discussion surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in 
education is attracting an increasingly broad audience. The growing 
interest in DEI issues is undoubtedly commendable, marking significant 
progress toward making education engaging and equitable for all stu-
dents. However, a persistent gap in educational attainment arises from 
the complex interplay of historical, economic, socio-political, and moral 
factors (Ladson-Billings, 2006). According to Ladson-Billings (2006), 
this achievement gap has long existed, disproportionately placing Afri-
can American and Latino students at the lower end of the academic 
achievement spectrum compared to their White counterparts.
Another key topic in DEI discussions is the representation of diverse 
student and teacher identities in the learning process and curriculum. 
Identity, defined as how we understand and come to know ourselves, is 
inseparable from self-perception and significantly influences learning 
(Altugan, 2015; Shields, 1999). Bliuc et al. (2011) suggest that learning 
is most successful when students can connect their personal, historical, 
and cultural identities to their educational experiences, as these ele-
ments enable their voices to be meaningfully represented in the class-
room. Identity is also critical because how student identity is 
acknowledged and treated in classrooms can shape motivation and 
engagement (Altugan, 2015). Similarly, teacher identity plays a crucial 
role in shaping teaching practices and classroom dynamics (Trent, 
2010).
Recognizing the importance of identity in the classroom, some 
empirical studies have examined its impact on learning outcomes. For 
instance, Malone and Barabino (2009) discuss how racial and cultural 
identity are closely linked to retention and meaningful participation in 
STEM fields. Thus, the intersection of student identity, teacher identity, 
and teaching and learning practices is essential to understanding DEI in 
education, as it can lead to both opportunities and challenges in stu-
dents’ future trajectories (Malone & Barabino, 2009).
While DEI scholarship underscores the importance of recognizing 
and valuing diverse identities in education, culturally relevant pedagogy 
(CRP) offers a concrete instructional framework to operationalize these 
principles in practice. Building on DEI foundations, CRP translates broad 
commitments to diversity and equity into classroom strategies that 
intentionally connect students’ cultural backgrounds with their aca-
demic learning.
2.2. Culturally relevant pedagogy
One of the approaches to addressing DEI in education is through the 
application of socio-emotional learning principles in lesson design and 
implementation. This socio-emotional framework has contributed to the 
emergence of CRP, which actively incorporates cultural elements and 
bridges 
students’ 
home 
cultures 
with 
classroom 
content 
(Ladson-Billings, 1995b). As Ladson-Billings (2006) illustrates, teachers 
can observe and learn from students’ home environments to meaning-
fully integrate cultural knowledge into instruction, using culture as a 
powerful tool for engaging learning. CRP moves beyond simply ac-
commodating marginalized students’ backgrounds within the dominant 
culture; instead, it fosters a dynamic and reciprocal relationship be-
tween home culture and classroom learning (Ladson-Billings, 1995a).
CRP is grounded in several core pillars. The first is cultural compe-
tence, which involves understanding one’s own cultural identity while 
recognizing and valuing multiple perspectives (Ladson-Billings, 1995a). 
Students who develop cultural competence are better able to appreciate 
both their own and others’ cultural backgrounds. Importantly, CRP 
helps students maintain cultural integrity, empowering them to resist 
pressure to conform to mainstream norms simply to gain social accep-
tance. Another foundational pillar is an emphasis on academic success. 
Ladson-Billings (1995a) argues that CRP is not solely about cultural 
identity; it must also support students’ academic achievement. CRP 
promotes the development of foundational skills in literacy, numeracy, 
and digital literacy. By centering academic success, CRP challenges 
structural inequalities and helps create classrooms where all students 
can become engaged, empowered learners.
In this study, we draw on these two pillars, cultural competence and 
academic success, to examine how inclusive AI curricula are imple-
mented and designed, and how such curricula influence academic 
learning outcomes, particularly for underrepresented student groups. As

AI and related technologies enter classrooms, these pedagogical com-
mitments highlight the need to ensure that AI-enhanced learning envi-
ronments affirm student identities while supporting academic 
achievement. This link between CRP and AI education is particularly 
important for addressing existing inequities in technology access and 
participation.
2.3. Inclusive and equitable AI in education
As AI becomes an integral and ubiquitous part of daily life, it is 
widely recognized that AI technologies are transforming schools and 
classrooms. While AI is often promoted as a tool for innovation and 
opportunity, there is growing concern that it may unintentionally 
exclude or disadvantage students who have historically had less access 
to technological resources. Selwyn (2022) emphasizes that some harms 
associated with AI tend to affect those who are less included in main-
stream technology initiatives, calling for deeper reflection on fairness, 
transparency, and accountability in its educational use. In response, this 
study aims to review and synthesize pedagogical principles and strate-
gies that promote inclusive practices in AI education, along with their 
associated learning outcomes, with a particular focus on equitably 
supporting student populations who have been underserved in tradi-
tional computing and technology learning environments.
Three student populations are especially important to consider in AI 
and computer science (CS) education: students of color, female students, 
and students from low-income backgrounds (Beyer, 2014; Chklovski 
et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2023; Shams et al., 2023; Whitcomb et al., 2021). 
Shams et al. (2023) highlight a lack of attention to racial equity in the 
design and implementation of AI and CS education. Solyst et al. (2023)
note that African American students remain underrepresented in the 
fields of AI and technology design, which contributes to unequal access 
to educational resources and learning experiences. Barretto et al. (2021)
also point out limited research exploring how students from diverse 
racial and ethnic backgrounds experience machine learning and AI 
courses. Their findings show that African American and Hispanic stu-
dents are less likely to enroll in introductory AI and ML classes, nar-
rowing future academic and career pathways.
Gender equity continues to be a pressing concern. In a survey of 603 
high school students, Lee et al. (2023) found that female students were 
significantly less likely to enroll in CS courses. This trend was largely 
attributed to lower confidence in their CS abilities, which in turn 
discouraged them from pursuing related careers. The absence of visible 
female role models in the field compounds this issue. Studies by Finzel 
et al. (2018), Jiang et al. (2024), and Roopaei et al. (2021) emphasize 
the need for mentorship and networking opportunities to support female 
students in CS and AI education.
Socioeconomic status (SES) also plays a significant role in shaping 
students’ access to AI learning. Chklovski et al. (2019) report that stu-
dents from low-income households are often excluded from opportu-
nities to participate in AI-enhanced classes. They call for AI curricula 
that are specifically designed to support students in under-resourced 
schools and communities. Similarly, Vandenberg et al. (2023) focus on 
students in rural areas who often face reduced access to high-paying 
technology jobs and fewer opportunities to engage with AI content in 
meaningful ways.
These challenges have led to the development of culturally relevant 
computing (CRC), an approach that intentionally connects computing 
education to students’ cultural and local experiences (Scott et al., 2015). 
CRC draws on ethnographic tools and cultural knowledge to create 
learning environments that reflect and honor students’ identities and 
communities (Kafai et al., 2014; Ryoo, 2019). This approach fosters 
deeper connections between computational concepts and students’ lived 
experiences (Madkins et al., 2019). Incorporating culture and identity 
into AI education has been shown to enhance student engagement, 
persistence, and success (Sanusi & Olaleye, 2022). By placing students’ 
backgrounds at the center of the learning process, CRC supports the 
development of inclusive and engaging AI learning experiences that 
affirm students’ voices and strengths (Kafai et al., 2014).
Taken together, these strands establish a conceptual foundation for 
this review. DEI research highlights the systemic and identity-based 
challenges students face, CRP illustrates how cultural identity and aca-
demic success can be jointly nurtured through pedagogy, and inclusive 
AI scholarship shows how these principles must extend into emerging 
technological domains. Synthesizing across these perspectives, the pre-
sent study reviews instructional strategies that integrate AI in ways that 
advance equity, cultural relevance, and meaningful student learning 
outcomes.
3. Methodology
3.1. Identification
This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, as outlined by Moher 
et al. (2015), to guide the identification, screening, and selection of 
relevant literature. The PRISMA protocol includes systematic proced-
ures for data collection from established databases, application of 
eligibility and exclusion criteria, and processes for screening, eligibility 
review, data abstraction, and analysis. Adhering to this guideline 
enabled the research team to conduct a transparent and replicable 
search for empirical studies focused on inclusive AI education in K–12 
classrooms.
The initial search was conducted across four major academic data-
bases: EBSCO, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore. 
These databases were selected based on their relevance and coverage of 
peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings in education and 
computing. EBSCO and Web of Science provided access to education- 
focused journals, while ACM and IEEE Xplore were chosen for their 
emphasis on computing and AI education research.
Search strings were tailored to each database’s logic and included 
combinations of the following terms: “culturally relevant AI in K-12,” 
“inclusive AI in K-12,” “culturally relevant technology in K-12,” and “in-
clusive technology in K-12”. These search terms were informed by prior 
literature on culturally responsive and inclusive pedagogy. Each of the 
three researchers conducted the search independently using their 
assigned terms and databases. Search results were then consolidated and 
cross-checked collaboratively to avoid duplication and reduce bias. In 
addition to the database search, a manual backward snowballing 
method was applied to identify additional relevant studies through the 
reference lists of included articles.
3.2. Screening and eligibility
To ensure relevance and quality, several inclusion and exclusion 
criteria were applied. Studies were included if they met the following 
conditions: (1) published in or after 2013; (2) written in English; (3) 
available in full text; and (4) published as a peer-reviewed journal article 
or conference proceeding. This screening criteria excluded systematic 
review articles, book series, book chapters, and working papers.
After this initial screening criteria, the second step of inclusion 
criteria was in two aspects: (1) reported empirical or experimental 
research; and (2) focused on the K-12 educational context. This review 
intended to limit its scope to studying empirical research to effectively 
address the core research question, which was to explore varying de-
scriptions of inclusive and culturally relevant instructional strategies 
that were employed in an authentic school setting. Literature review and 
theoretical pieces were excluded at this stage because theory focused 
articles failed to deliver an authentic description of the real-time class-
room intervention. The scope was intentionally limited to empirical 
studies to ensure that the review captured descriptions of instructional 
strategies and learning outcomes grounded in real-world classroom 
implementations. Theoretical or conceptual papers were excluded to 
H. Lee et al.

focus on authentic, practice-based evidence. A backward snowballing 
method (Zhan et al., 2024) was also used to identify relevant references 
cited in the selected articles. Each article was carefully reviewed to 
confirm that it met the inclusion criteria. This process yielded a final set 
of 17 studies that met all eligibility requirements. The article selection 
process is summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 1.
3.3. Data abstraction
Following the PRISMA protocol and the backward snowballing 
method, a total of 17 articles were ultimately selected to be studied and 
examined (See Fig. 1). Themes and sub-themes were initially identified 
by reviewing article titles and abstracts, followed by full-text reviews. 
Using a qualitative data analysis approach, the researchers identified 
patterns reflecting culturally relevant and inclusive instructional stra-
tegies and associated learning outcomes in K-12 AI education. Themes 
were organized into broader categories to create a typology that aligns 
with the research questions. The three researchers went through 
consecutive iterative rounds of reviewing the selected articles to 
generate the framework. The core themes and sub themes were also 
meticulously cross-checked to ensure that all researchers have a 
consistent understanding of the coding framework. As a result of 
rigorous rounds of cross checking, the researchers were able to apply the 
themes uniformly when categorizing the articles.

3.4. Data analysis
We conducted a scoping literature review (Munn et al., 2018) to 
analyze data. According to Munn et al. (2018), scoping reviews are 
conducted to explore the scope and range of a specific body of literature 
on a given topic. Scoping reviews are as valuable as systematic literature 
reviews in that they provide an overview of the focused topic by rigor-
ously synthesizing research evidence. Pham et al. (2014) emphasize that 
scoping reviews are particularly useful when a research area is emergent 
or not yet extensively reviewed. While no universally accepted protocol 
for scoping reviews exists, most follow the framework proposed by 
Arksey and O’Malley (2005), which includes five key stages: (1) iden-
tifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) 
selecting studies; (4) mapping the data; and (5) summarizing and 
reporting the results. To analyze the findings, we applied thematic 
analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2012) to identify recurring patterns and 
extract emerging themes across the reviewed articles.
Given the limited research specifically addressing inclusive AI edu-
cation, this methodological approach was deemed appropriate. The 
scoping review allowed the researchers to rigorously explore and syn-
thesize a fragmented body of literature, map its key characteristics, and 
identify trends in instructional practices and learning outcomes related 
to inclusive and culturally relevant AI education in K-12 settings.
4. Results
This section presents the findings of the scoping review, organized 
according to the three research questions. Research question 1 in-
vestigates the contexts and characteristics of inclusive AI curricula in K- 
12 education through a descriptive review, focusing on publication 
trends, participant demographics, and curriculum settings. Research 
questions 2 and 3 synthesize findings related to instructional strategies 
and associated learning outcomes, respectively, to explore how inclusive 
practices are implemented and evaluated in classroom environments.
4.1. RQ1. Contexts and characteristics of the selected research
Between 2013 and 2024, a total of 17 empirical studies were iden-
tified that examined AI- or technology-integrated education designed for 
underserved K-12 student populations. Table 2 summarizes key infor-
mation from these studies, including author(s), publication year, digital 
platforms or tools used, grade level, and subject areas. As noted earlier, 
three populations such as students of color, female students, and stu-
dents from low-income backgrounds are frequently described in the 
computing education literature as underrepresented groups. To reflect 
this, the “Participant” column in Table 2 specifies demographic details.
Fig. 2 illustrates the frequency of publications from 2013 to 2024. A 
total of 17 publications were identified, indicating a relatively low 
overall publication rate. The number of publications fluctuated between 
one and two annually from 2013 to 2017. No publications were found in 
2016, 2021, and 2023 (n = 0). However, the highest number of publi-
cations were found in 2019 and 2022 (n = 3). This fluctuation in pub-
lications shows that the field remains relatively niche within the broader 
educational research landscape and this limited body of research high-
lights the need for further exploration.
In our data collection, we labelled the literature into two categories: 
conference proceedings (n = 10, 58.8 %) and journal articles (n = 7, 
41.2 %). The results reveal that research related to AI and new tech-
nology targeted at underrepresented participants in culturally relevant 
and inclusive education is still strongly represented in conference pro-
ceedings, while also seeing a notable increase in journal publication over 
time.
Fig. 3 depicts the subject frequency of integrating AI and new tech-
nology among underrepresented participants. While our findings indi-
cate CS remains the primary focus (64.7 %, with a frequency of 11) 
which encompasses subfields such as AI (Dangol et al., 2024; Druga 
et al., 2019), coding (Codding et al., 2019), game development (Fowler 
& Khosmood, 2018), Scratch programming (Franklin et al., 2020), and 
general CS (Ladeji-Osias et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2015; Simley et al., 2020; 
Solyst et al., 2022; Williams et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2022). Our finding 
also indicated an emergent trend of integration AI and new technology 
among underrepresented participants has expanded into fields like 
Technology (Vakil, 2014), Mathematics (Bertrand et al., 2024; Eglash 
et al., 2013), English (Louie et al., 2022), STEAM (Manikutty et al., 
2019), and Arts (Kafai et al., 2014). This distribution suggests a 
concentrated effort to engage underrepresented participants in CS, while 
also demonstrating a promising expansion into diverse disciplines to 
foster broader technological literacy and inclusivity.
Fig. 4 illustrates the diverse range of technologies used in this 
research, from familiar software to robotics and AI. Specifically, game 
development platforms like Kodu Game Lab (Fowler & Khosmood, 
2018) have been used in the CS class for game development. Simulations 
and virtual worlds like Cospaces Edu (Bertrand et al., 2024), i Life (Lee 
et al., 2015), Sims TM (Lee et al., 2015), and Teen Second Life (Lee et al., 
2015) have been used in pre-built environments for exploring real-world 
scenarios. Additionally, the integration of AI and programming is 
evident in the use of advanced language models like Chat GPT 3.5 
(Dangol et al., 2024), Teachable Machine (Xia et al., 2022). While tools

4.2. RQ2. Instructional strategies to broaden participation for inclusive AI
To address research question 2, we synthesized common instruc-
tional principles and pedagogical considerations from the selected 
studies. This analysis led to the development of an Inclusive AI Frame-
work (Fig. 5), which illustrates five core themes for designing and 
implementing inclusive AI and technology-enhanced curricula: Identity, 
Technology, Design, Content Development, and Sense of Belonging. Each of 
these themes comprises associated sub-themes that reflect specific 
instructional strategies drawn from the reviewed literature. These are 
further detailed in Table 3, which includes definitions and supporting 
studies for each sub-theme.
Principle 1. Identity
When designing lessons that incorporate AI and technology to 
broaden student participation, educators must intentionally center stu-
dents’ backgrounds, identities, cultures, and lived experiences. The 
Identity theme consists of three key sub-themes: cultural synchronization, 
positionality, and relevance. These instructional principles emphasize that 
inclusive AI education requires educators to both affirm who students 
are and connect learning to what they value and experience in their 
daily lives.
Principle 1.1. Cultural Synchronization: Culturally relevant lessons should reflect 
students’ identities and cultural backgrounds.
The most frequently observed sub-theme in the reviewed literature 
was cultural synchronization, found in twelve studies. This principle 
underscores the importance of aligning instruction with students’ cul-
tural identities and community practices. Originally introduced by 
Irvine (1991), the term cultural synchronization described the inter-
personal alignment needed between Black students and teachers, urging 
educators to recognize and honor culturally rooted patterns of 
communication and values such as spirituality, mutuality, and 
responsibility.
Eglash et al. (2013), for example, applied this principle by intro-
ducing African American students to fractal and recursive geometry 
through culturally meaningful references, such as cornrow hairstyles, a 
symbolic element of African American youth culture. Similarly, Kafai 
et al. (2014) implemented culturally responsive design activities using 
electronic textiles, drawing on students’ indigenous knowledge. These 
culturally grounded instructional strategies not only validated students’ 
identities but also significantly enhanced engagement and participation.
Principle 1.2. Positionality: Educators should acknowledge their own identities and 
the intersectional cultural positions of their students.
The second sub-theme, positionality, was emphasized in six studies. 
This principle calls on instructors to be self-reflective and aware of how 
their own cultural, racial, and gender identities influence classroom 
dynamics and curriculum development. Codding et al. (2019) empha-
sized that addressing the underrepresentation of students in CS requires 
instructors to recognize the significance of their own identities and 
intentionally serve as affirming role models.
Positionality also includes the practice of employing mentors and 
facilitators who share similar cultural or gender identities with students. 
For instance, ethnically matched or same-gender mentors can foster 
stronger connections, increase trust, and affirm students’ sense of 
belonging. In this way, positionality supports the development of in-
clusive learning environments where students feel seen and valued.
Principle 1.3. Relevance: Lessons should be connected to students’ lived 
experiences, interests, and everyday realities.
The third sub-theme, relevance, highlights the importance of con-
necting instructional content to students’ lives beyond the classroom. 
This includes incorporating topics, examples, and activities that reflect 
students’ personal interests, family contexts, and cultural histories.

Bertrand et al. (2024) offer a compelling example of this principle in 
action. In their study, a student developed a digital storytelling project 
called Chef Bot using augmented reality (AR), inspired by her father’s 
career as a chef. By embedding personal and cultural experiences into 
the curriculum, the student not only deepened her learning but also 
gained a sense of ownership and authenticity in her work.
Principle 2. Technology
When integrating AI and emerging technologies into the classroom, 
educators must consider how to avoid unintentionally reinforcing 
existing inequalities. AI, while full of promise, can also function as a 
disruptive force if implementation is not thoughtfully designed. Our 
findings revealed three key principles to support equitable and inclusive 
technology use: accessibility, up-to-date AI, and digital literacy.
Principle 2.1. Accessibility: Utilize cost-effective technological tools to enhance 
student access.
High costs associated with AI tools, software, and hardware can 
create significant barriers to participation, especially for students from 
low socioeconomic backgrounds. Ensuring accessibility means selecting 
tools that are affordable, compatible with students’ available devices, 
and useable both in and out of school settings.
For instance, Manikutty et al. (2019) addressed budgetary con-
straints in rural schools by utilizing low-cost educational robotics. While 
they initially conducted a pilot test with the Hummingbird Duo Micro-
controller, it was later replaced with the more affordable BBC micro:bit 
to broaden accessibility for students. This thoughtful substitution of 
inexpensive materials significantly increased access for rural learners. 
Similarly, Fowler and Khosmood (2018) emphasized the importance of 
selecting tools that are free of cost and accessible for students to use both 
in school and at home. Solyst et al. (2022) further highlighted the 
challenges faced by marginalized students who often rely on tablets or 
mobile phones rather than state-of-the-art laptops. They encountered 
compatibility issues with a specific platform that required non-mobile 
devices, underscoring the necessity of identifying alternative solutions 
to include these learners. These examples illustrate the critical role of 
accessibility in ensuring that all students can benefit from technological 
advancements in education.
Principle 2.2. Up-to-Date AI: Ensure tools and technologies are accurate, current, 
and aligned with emerging developments.
To promote meaningful engagement and digital relevance, educators 
must adopt AI tools and platforms that reflect current technological 
developments. Using outdated or static tools may limit students’ expo-
sure to real-world applications and diminish their preparedness for 
future AI-related careers.
Druga et al. (2019) emphasized the benefits of using emerging 
technologies to increase student motivation and interactivity. Their 
study demonstrated how current tools, such as AI-powered smart as-
sistants and conversational agents, encouraged exploration in young 
learners. Integrating timely technologies can help students see the 
relevance of AI in their daily lives, which in turn boosts engagement and 
learning retention.
However, keeping technologies current also requires ongoing eval-
uation and professional learning for educators. Instructors must stay 
informed about advancements to choose tools that are pedagogically 
sound and technologically appropriate for their students. Up-to-date AI 
resources not only enhance student interest but also ensure alignment 
with the rapidly evolving digital landscape. This principle emphasizes 
that inclusivity entails equitable exposure to innovation, ensuring that 
all students, regardless of background, are equipped to engage with and 
contribute to the future of AI.
Principle 2.3. Digital Literacy: Consider students’ varying digital skill levels when 
designing technology-integrated lessons.
Not all students enter the classroom with the same level of digital 
proficiency. Educators must assess and respond to students’ digital lit-
eracy levels to ensure equitable participation. While some students may 
be adept at navigating complex digital tools, others may struggle with 
foundational skills such as account setup, file sharing, or navigating 
interfaces.
To bridge this gap, personalization and collaborative support struc-
tures are essential. For example, Franklin et al. (2020) accommodated 
diverse skill levels by providing example code and structured work-
sheets to scaffold students’ learning. Bertrand et al. (2024) noted that 
peer support emerged naturally, as students with stronger digital skills 
helped classmates who were less experienced. Solyst et al. (2022) further 
emphasized that instructors should actively encourage students with 
limited prior exposure to technology by offering flexible timelines, 
differentiated support, and a growth-oriented mindset. These ap-
proaches foster confidence and ensure all students are able to mean-
ingfully engage in AI learning experiences.
Principle 3. Design
The third theme focuses on Design, specifically in the context of 
curriculum development. Design should be participatory, student- 
centered, and personalized. Below are the sub-principles derived from our 
findings, highlighting design considerations that promote meaningful 
student participation.
Principle 3.1. Participatory Design: Actively invite practitioners and students to 
contribute their perspectives in lesson development.
Participatory design emphasizes the importance of including diverse 
stakeholders inclusive of teachers, researchers, and students in the 
curriculum development process to ensure that all voices are heard. This 
approach fosters a sense of ownership and promotes inclusivity and 
collaboration in designing learning experiences.
Researchers should actively partner with teachers, who have deep 
knowledge of their students and classroom contexts. In addition, 
inviting students to contribute their interests and draw on prior expe-
riences enhances the relevance and responsiveness of instruction 
(Dangol et al., 2024; Louie et al., 2022). The involvement of both 
teachers and students helps cultivate a shared sense of responsibility and 
ownership in the learning process.
Principle 3.2. Student-Centered Design: Provide students with choices, 
opportunities, and ownership over their learning.
The lesson and learning activities should be designed with a student- 
centered approach. Such a design provides students with diverse op-
portunities and choices aligned with their interests, thereby fostering a 
sense of ownership in their learning process. For example, Druga et al. 
(2019) emphasized the importance of granting student’s agency and 
opportunities within learning activities. Moreover, Manikutty et al. 
(2019) developed learning environments that allowed students to select 
topics they found engaging and wished to explore further. Furthermore, 
when teachers provide more autonomy and choices to students, they 
increase motivation and ownership, and the gap between girls and boys, 
and high and low achievers are reduced (Xia et al., 2022).
Principle 3.3. Personalization: Lessons should be designed to support personalized 
learning and meet each student’s needs.
Personalized learning involves tailoring curriculum and activities to 
accommodate students’ varying backgrounds, needs, and levels of prior 
H. Lee et al.

knowledge. Ladeji-Osias et al. (2018) underscored the significance of 
differentiated instruction, noting that students possess varying levels of 
experience and knowledge in AI. Teachers should therefore provide 
technology-related activities that align with students’ individual needs 
and prior knowledge. Similarly, Solyst et al. (2022) emphasized that a 
single schedule does not accommodate all groups effectively. They 
highlighted the importance of allocating additional time for diverse 
learners, recognizing that students have different learning paces.
Principle 4. Content development
The fourth theme is Content Development, which closely relates to 
Principle 3: Design. While design focuses on the overall structure and 
approach to curriculum creation, content development emphasizes the 
nature and presentation of the learning materials themselves. Effective 
content should be open-ended, collaborative, and incorporate multiple 
forms of representation to support diverse learners.
Principle 4.1. Open-Ended Tasks: Include content that allows for open-ended 
exploration.
Numerous studies shed light on the importance of open-ended tasks 
and learning activities (Franklin et al., 2020; Kafai et al., 2014; Lade-
ji-Osias et al., 2018). For instance, Kafai et al. (2014) stated the 
open-ended task when student designed e-textile and Franklin et al. 
(2020) highlighted offering open-ended activities to position students as 
creators. When educators design lessons and learning activities, 
open-ended tasks are desirable rather than closed-ended activities to 
promote creativity and critical thinking.
Principle 4.2. Collaborative Work: Structure curricula to promote collaborative 
group work.
Another important aspect of content development is the integration 
of collaborative learning. Structuring curricula to encourage peer 
interaction promotes social learning and shared understanding. Ber-
trand et al. (2024) highlighted that students formed groups with various 
peers they had not previously collaborated with and interacted with the 
tools together. While exploring the tools, students helped each other and 
the students who were less comfortable with the tools were supported by 
their peers. Dangol et al. (2024) noted that students invited their peers 
and did collaboration work to understand cultural concepts and to refine 
their conceptual understanding of AI.
Principle 4.3. Multimodality: Offer diverse forms of expression to engage multiple 
learning styles.
The final principle that emerged is multimodality, which emphasizes 
the importance of providing various forms of representation and 
expression to engage students with different learning styles. This in-
cludes incorporating images, symbols, and sounds to enrich the learning 
experience. For example, Franklin et al. (2020) emphasized the value of 
culturally relevant projects, such as music composition and historical 
bead-making, where technology served as a medium to align with and 
celebrate students’ cultural identities. Similarly, Solyst et al. (2022)
recommended that educators and curriculum developers utilize multiple 
modalities when delivering online classes, moving beyond simple chat 
functions. They highlighted the need to use diverse spaces and modal-
ities to monitor and support students in real time, enhancing both visi-
bility and scalability.
Principle 5. Sense of belonging
The final principle is Sense of Belonging, which highlights the 
importance of creating supportive learning environments where stu-
dents feel accepted, valued, and connected. A strong sense of belonging 
is cultivated through relationships and rapport with instructors and 
peers, as well as through engagement with the broader community.
Principle 5.1. Rapport: Foster strong, positive relationships in the learning 
environments.
The first principle related to fostering a sense of belonging is rapport, 
which is essential for establishing strong relationships between in-
structors and students. Positive rapport enables students to feel sup-
ported and engaged, as they are often significantly influenced by their 
teachers. Vakil (2014) highlighted the need to reframe traditional 
teacher-student relationships, advocating for dialogic communication as 
a means to enhance student engagement. In addition to the rapport 
between instructors and students, the development of rapport among 
students is equally critical. Solyst et al. (2022) emphasized the impor-
tance of learner-learner rapport, noting that it fosters mutual support 
and connectedness and contributes to building a sense of community 
within the learning environment.
Principle 5.2. Community Engagement: Develop partnerships with the local 
community and address relevant issues to enhance community building.
The final principle is community engagement, which emphasizes 
partnerships between instructors, researchers, and local communities, 
often addressing the specific needs of those communities. For example, 
in the study by Codding et al. (2019), a local library collaborated on a 
coding club project. Librarians had previously struggled to engage youth 
in traditional library activities, often perceiving their presence as 
stressful and disruptive. However, the implementation of a culturally 
responsive coding project not only enhanced students’ confidence in CS 
but also improved their experiences in the library, reducing tensions and 
transforming the dynamic between youth and the library space. Addi-
tionally, students redefined their perceptions of the library. Community 
engagement also allows students to engage in learning activities that 
address community-specific issues, fostering a sense of community 
building. For instance, in the study by Lee et al. (2015), students 
participated in a technology program designed to tackle gentrification 
issues in urban areas, contributing as active members of their 
community.
4.3. RQ3. Learning outcomes
We examined the learning outcomes reported across the selected 
studies as a result of the instructional strategies described in RQ2. Of the 
seventeen total articles, fifteen studies explicitly or implicitly reported 
on student learning outcomes. Among these, thirteen studies provided 
clear evidence, either quantitative (e.g., pre/post assessments, validated 
survey instruments) or qualitative (e.g., interview excerpts, classroom 
observations). The remaining two studies made general claims such as 
“students improved motivation” or “enhanced knowledge,” but did not 
include concrete evidence to substantiate those outcomes.
Learning outcomes were categorized into four major dimensions: 
cognitive, affective, meta-cognitive, and social. These dimensions and their 
associated themes are presented in Table 4, along with the studies 
supporting each category. The cognitive dimension included outcomes 
such as technical AI knowledge, programming skills, and integration of 
AI concepts with content-area learning (e.g., math or science). The af-
fective dimension encompassed student confidence, academic and 
career motivation, interest in learning, and perceptions of the usefulness 
of technology. The meta-cognitive dimension included outcomes related 
to students’ ability to self-regulate their learning. The social dimension 
reflected outcomes in communication and collaboration skills, particu-
larly in group or project-based activities.
Several studies demonstrated strong links between specific instruc-
tional strategies and learning gains. For instance, AI-based personali-
zation and student-centered project work were associated with cognitive 
and 
meta-cognitive 
benefits, 
including 
improved 
conceptual

understanding and self-regulation. Collaborative design tasks and 
culturally relevant activities were often connected to affective and social 
outcomes, such as increased motivation, STEM career interest, and 
enhanced communication skills.
Integrating AI into instruction has been shown to enhance student 
learning in both CS and core academic subjects. For example, Lade-
ji-Osias et al. (2018) reported that students demonstrated increased 
computing knowledge and skills through participation in AI-enhanced 
activities. Similarly, Bertrand et al. (2024) found that students 
improved their mathematical understanding while designing AI pro-
totypes for creating virtual buildings. Simley et al. (2020) implemented 
a project that combined coding with both mathematics and science in-
struction. Students engaged in programming tasks that addressed 
mathematical topics such as angle relationships, algebraic expressions, 
systems of equations, and geometric labeling, as well as scientific con-
cepts including velocity, speed, distance, acceleration, Newton’s Laws, 
inertia, momentum, force, and fractions. As a result of this interdisci-
plinary integration, students demonstrated improved performance on 
math and science assessments.
In addition to cognitive gains, the reviewed studies reported a range 
of affective learning outcomes. The use of AI and advanced technologies 
supported students’ confidence (Codding et al., 2019), motivation 
(Manikutty et al., 2019), and readiness to engage with AI in daily con-
texts (Xia et al., 2022). Several studies also documented increased in-
terest in future STEM careers as a result of AI-integrated learning 
experiences (Ladeji-Osias et al., 2018; Simley et al., 2020), as well as 
positive perceptions of the usefulness of technology (Eglash et al., 2013; 
Fowler & Khosmood, 2018).
Meta-cognitive outcomes were evident in studies highlighting self- 
regulation. Xia et al. (2022), for example, reported that inclusive AI 
curricula benefited both boys and girls, as well as both high- and 
low-performing students, in developing stronger self-regulation skills. 
Social outcomes were also noted: Bertrand et al. (2024) highlighted that 
students of color demonstrated improved communication skills when 
engaged in collaborative AI design tasks.
Overall, the reviewed studies indicate that AI-integrated curricula 
can foster meaningful cognitive, affective, meta-cognitive, and social 
learning outcomes, with particular benefits for underrepresented 
students.
5. Discussion
5.1. Contexts
This research finding indicates a growing trend of integrating AI and 
new technologies into K-12 education. Our findings revealed a diverse 
range of subjects utilizing AI and technology, with most studies focused 
on CS. However, other disciplines, such as language, arts, and mathe-
matics, have also incorporated technology. This suggests that AI and 
technology are not limited to standalone CS classes but are integrated 
across various subjects. UNESCO (2022) emphasizes that digital skills 
can be enhanced by embedding them into different subjects and con-
texts, rather than confining them to CS courses. Consistent with this 
view, numerous studies have examined the use of AI and technology 
across various disciplines (Kaspersen et al., 2022; Katuka et al., 2024). 
However, despite these efforts, there remains a gap in integrating AI and 
technology into fields outside of CS, as our findings indicate that over 70 
% of implementations occurred in CS or technology classes, with less 
than 30 % in other subjects. Given that not all schools offer dedicated CS 
courses, embedding AI and technology across subjects could provide 
students with more equitable and accessible opportunities to develop AI 
literacy. We also suggest and recommend integration of AI in various 
contexts since study (Lin & Van Brummelen, 2021) has concluded that 
exposure to AI in diverse disciplines inspires students to pursue careers 
in CS.
Our findings indicate that the majority of studies focused on the 
middle school level. While middle school is critical for developing 
technological fluency, this finding highlights a potential two research 
gaps. The first research gap is limited research focus on students at the 
elementary school level. This gap is significant because early exposure to 
computing concepts has been shown to significantly impact students’ 
long-term interest and success in CS (Lee et al., 2023). The second 
research gap is a lack of longitude research in this field. While many 
studies explore the short-term effects of integration AI or technology, 
more research is needed to understand the long-term impacts on stu-
dents’ learning, attitudes, and future engagement. To promote inclusive 
and equitable AI education, further research is needed to explore how to 
implement AI and technology for elementary school students. The lack 
of research in this area further underscores the existing digital divide 
and inequality among marginalized populations, aligning with previous 
findings that emphasize the persistence of the digital divide and 
inequality among marginalized populations (Banister & Fischer, 2010). 
To bridge the gap, it is imperative that educators, policymakers, and 
researchers collaborate to ensure equitable access to these technologies, 
providing all students with the opportunity to thrive in an increasingly 
AI-driven world. By fostering early engagement with AI concepts, we 
can empower a wider range of students to become active participants 
and shape the future of this transformative technology.
5.2. Instructional strategies and considerations for inclusive AI and 
technology
Our findings indicated that the majority of the studies emphasized 
the importance of culture and identity. When educators embrace stu-
dents’ identity and funds of knowledge, and the curriculum is relevant to 
students’ interests and daily lives, students are more likely to get 
engaged in learning. Numerous studies in our findings used students’ 
home culture and interests to help them understand CS concepts or 
content knowledge in math and science. This aligns with the literature 
that integrating cultural competence elements into the technology me-
dium is effective for helping students better understand difficult con-
cepts in subject areas (Sanusi & Olaleye, 2022). This suggests that 
instructors need to pay attention to students’ backgrounds, culture, in-
terests, and characteristics.
Furthermore, our findings showed that the role of instructor and 
facilitators were critical. Their ethnical positionality influenced student 
learning. Furthermore, the same gender role-model also affected female 
students to have positive perceptions to pursue career paths in STEM. 
We need to broaden participation in computing, AI, and technology, 
especially for female students. Building good relationships between in-
structors and students is also important. This aligns with existing 
research (Beyer, 2014). Lee et al. (2023) noted that female students were

more influenced than male students by their teachers in CS class. Thus, 
when students have a good relationship with teachers/instructors, more 
female students are likely to participate in and be interested in AI and 
technology.
Moreover, community involvement is essential for inclusive 
learning. Not all schools are offering CS or AI-related courses. In 
particular, low-income schools have limited budgets to buy technolog-
ical tools, and some schools have limited teachers prepared to get ready 
to teach AI (Kim & Lee, 2025; Lee & Lee, 2025). In these cases, students 
have limited access to learn AI-related lessons. Thus, informal settings 
such as libraries or partnership with local institutions might be good 
resources for low-income students to have access to learn AI. Addi-
tionally, our findings revealed that when students had projects related to 
community issues, they were more engaged and felt a sense of 
belonging.
In designing inclusive AI curricula, careful attention must be paid not 
only to content but also to the design approach. Participatory design is 
particularly valuable, as it emphasizes the active involvement of both 
practitioners and students in the curriculum development process. By 
engaging these stakeholders early and meaningfully, designers can 
ensure that the curriculum is contextually relevant and responsive to 
learners’ needs. In addition, inclusive AI curricula should be student- 
centered and personalized. Actively involving students in shaping 
their learning experiences promotes a greater sense of ownership, which 
in turn has been linked to increased academic engagement and perfor-
mance (Lee & Park, 2024). To support this, learning activities should 
incorporate open-ended tasks and offer multiple modes of expression 
and representation, fostering creativity, critical thinking, and inclusiv-
ity. Collaborative learning also plays a critical role. When students work 
together, they not only receive peer support but also learn through 
modeling and shared problem-solving. In computing education, a sub-
stantial body of research (e.g., Hanks et al., 2011; Hannay et al., 2009; 
Williams & Upchurch, 2001) has demonstrated the benefits of pair 
programming and other peer collaboration models. These approaches 
have been shown to enhance student satisfaction, deepen understand-
ing, and reduce frustration, particularly when working with complex or 
unfamiliar technologies.
Our findings revealed that, although all studies were situated in 
technology-enhanced learning contexts, very few explicitly addressed 
how or why specific technologies were selected. For instance, Fowler 
and Khosmood (2018) provided a rare example of clear justification, 
noting that their chosen tool was age-appropriate, aligned with curric-
ulum goals, accessible at no cost, and useable both at school and at 
home. While a wide range of devices and platforms were used across the 
studies, most did not explain their selection criteria. We argue that 
future research should provide more detailed rationales for tool and 
platform selection, particularly in relation to student context, learning 
objectives, and accessibility. Despite the promise of AI and emerging 
technologies in education, our review revealed persistent inequities in 
access. Only a few studies considered the affordability of tools for stu-
dents from low-income backgrounds, and discussions of AI ethics, digital 
access, or technology-related constraints were notably scarce. These 
findings reinforce previous research highlighting the continued impact 
of the digital divide on underserved student populations (Banister & 
Fischer, 2010). As such, we emphasize the need for educators, re-
searchers, and policymakers to collaborate in selecting technologies that 
are 
not 
only 
pedagogically 
sound 
but 
also 
equitable 
and 
context-sensitive. Additionally, future research should investigate 
criteria and models for AI tool selection that balance pedagogical rele-
vance, accessibility for underserved learners, and alignment with ethical 
and contextual considerations. This line of inquiry could help educators 
and decision-makers make informed, equity-centered choices about 
technology adoption. Moreover, students’ varying levels of digital lit-
eracy must be accounted for during lesson design. While some students 
possess advanced technical skills, others face challenges with basic tasks 
such as creating accounts or navigating platforms. However, few studies 
in our review explicitly addressed digital literacy or AI literacy as a 
design consideration. To address this gap, we recommend incorporating 
pre-instructional orientation sessions to support students who may need 
additional assistance with the technical aspects of AI-enhanced learning 
environments.
5.3. Learning outcomes
Earlier sections of this review discussed the principles and consid-
erations for designing inclusive, technology-enhanced curricula. Our 
findings suggest that these instructional principles and strategies can 
positively impact student learning outcomes. Specifically, integrating AI 
and related technologies across subject areas was associated with 
enhanced access and engagement, as well as improved academic out-
comes. Several studies demonstrated that the use of AI and advanced 
technologies supported students’ content knowledge gains, not only in 
computer science but also in core subject areas where these tools were 
meaningfully integrated. This suggests a promising opportunity for ed-
ucators to actively incorporate AI into diverse disciplines to support 
student learning. Additionally, many studies reported affective benefits 
such as increased student engagement, motivation, and confidence. 
Students also developed important 21st-century competencies, 
including collaboration, communication, and self-regulation.
However, our analysis also revealed important gaps. A few studies 
did not report clear learning outcomes or focused exclusively on affec-
tive elements such as engagement and interest. In some cases, claims 
about increased motivation were based solely on informal observations 
or generalized statements, with no supporting evidence such as assess-
ments, student artifacts, or survey data. This raises an important ques-
tion: Do these instructional strategies for inclusive AI and technology 
integration demonstrably improve learning outcomes aligned with 
curricular goals? Without a clear connection between student engage-
ment and measurable cognitive outcomes, it becomes difficult to justify 
the educational value of these tools. If AI or advanced technologies are 
used solely to increase engagement without alignment to content stan-
dards, learning objectives, or assessment strategies, they risk being 
perceived as supplementary rather than integral to academic success. 
Furthermore, while some studies explicitly used AI to support 
computing skills in CS classrooms, others applied AI in non-CS subjects 
such as science or mathematics. In these cases, clear justification is 
needed for why particular AI tools were used, how they were aligned 
with learning standards, and what specific learning goals they 
addressed. Our review found that this rationale was often missing or 
underdeveloped.
We recommend that future research provide balanced evidence of 
both cognitive and affective outcomes when evaluating the impact of AI- 
integrated curricula. It is also essential to ensure that technology inte-
gration is purposefully aligned with the subject-area standards and 
instructional goals. Doing so will strengthen the case for AI as a tool not 
only for engagement but for equitable, measurable academic 
advancement.
In evaluating learning outcomes, it is also important to consider the 
effectiveness of AI integration for diverse learners. Xia et al. (2022)
found that their AI-integrated curriculum supported learning for both 
high- and low-performing students, whereas a traditional instructional 
approach primarily benefited high performers. This finding aligns with 
previous research (Lee, 2024; Lee & Brush, 2025), which showed that 
AI-enhanced mathematics instruction helped reduce performance and 
motivation gaps between students at different achievement levels. These 
results suggest that AI integration, when thoughtfully designed, may 
serve as a gap-reducing mechanism that promotes more equitable 
learning outcomes. However, not all findings were uniformly positive. 
Druga et al. (2019) reported that students from low-income schools 
encountered more challenges in engaging with AI tools, particularly in 
iterative design tasks, compared to students from more affluent schools. 
This underscores the ongoing inequities in access, preparation, and 
H. Lee et al.

support that must be addressed if AI is to truly serve all learners equi-
tably. Taken together, these findings highlight the dual potential of AI in 
education: it can either narrow or widen existing gaps, depending on 
how it is implemented. Therefore, it is critical that educators and cur-
riculum developers apply inclusive design principles such as those 
identified in this review to support the academic success of students 
from diverse backgrounds and performance levels.
5.4. Implications for broadening participation across diverse student 
group
Our findings align with broader DEI concerns raised in prior studies 
(Fletcher & Warner, 2021; Shams et al., 2023), particularly related to 
ethnicity, gender, and SES in AI and CS education. Based on the evidence 
synthesized in this review, we offer several recommendations to support 
more inclusive and equitable learning environments.
To address ethnicity-related inequities, educators should incorporate 
cultural synchronization in lesson design, include ethnically matched 
mentors and role models, and intentionally connect content to students’ 
lived experiences and interests. These practices help affirm students’ 
cultural identities and foster engagement in AI learning. To support 
gender inclusion, strategies such as same-gender mentoring, exposure to 
diverse career pathways, and the cultivation of strong teacher–student 
rapport have shown promise in enhancing female students’ participation 
and confidence in CS and AI courses. For students from low socioeco-
nomic backgrounds, access remains a major barrier. Selecting cost- 
effective tools and platforms, offering professional development for 
teachers in under-resourced schools, and creating community-based 
learning opportunities, such as after-school programs and summer 
camps, can broaden access and support sustained participation.
Together, these strategies reflect the importance of designing inclu-
sive AI and CS education that not only adapts to students’ diverse needs 
but also actively seeks to reduce opportunity gaps. The instructional 
principles identified in this review provide practical guidance for 
addressing longstanding inequities and promoting success for all 
learners.
6. Conclusion
This scoping review explored the current landscape of inclusive and 
equitable AI curricula in K-12 education by examining the contexts of 
implementation, instructional principles, and reported learning out-
comes. Through the synthesis of empirical studies, we identified key 
design features and pedagogical strategies that support broader student 
participation in AI and technology-enhanced learning environments. By 
offering a synthesized framework of instructional strategies and out-
comes, this review provides practical guidance for educators and cur-
riculum developers seeking to foster inclusive participation in AI and CS 
education. This review was limited to four databases, and the inclusion 
of additional sources could broaden the design considerations and 
instructional strategies identified. Future research should cover more 
diverse perspectives and contexts. Despite this limitation, the review 
offers valuable insights into key design features and pedagogical stra-
tegies that can broaden student participation in AI and technology- 
enhanced learning, particularly for underrepresented groups. Building 
on these foundations, future studies could integrate more linguistically 
and culturally diverse perspectives, enabling a more comprehensive 
understanding of how inclusive AI education can address educational 
inequities and ensure that all learners are prepared to participate fully in 
an AI-driven world. Additionally, while our review focused on instruc-
tional strategies observed in K-12 classrooms and their associated stu-
dent learning outcomes, the effectiveness of these strategies depends 
heavily on teacher preparedness. Professional development opportu-
nities, particularly those emphasizing culturally responsive pedagogy, 
may be critical for enabling and sustaining inclusive AI instructional 
practices. Research examining how such training intersects with and 
enhances the instructional strategies identified in this review could 
further strengthen implementation and outcomes.
