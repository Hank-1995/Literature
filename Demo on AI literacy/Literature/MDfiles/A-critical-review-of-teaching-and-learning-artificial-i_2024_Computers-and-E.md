Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy education mainly targets secondary and university students, often overlooking 
the unique needs of younger students. This gap in AI literacy primary school education presents theoretical and 
pedagogical challenges. Despite the pervasive influence of AI, which can exacerbate inequalities and raise ethical 
challenges, primary students often lack an understanding of AI principles and mechanisms. Recent developments 
in age-appropriate AI learning tools have extended AI literacy to primary schools, but AI literacy frameworks for 
this age group remain underdeveloped. This study aims to conceptualize AI literacy by analyzing existing 
theoretical frameworks and proposing a new inclusive AI literacy framework for young students. A scoping 
review is employed using four credible index databases, and 19 articles are selected, with 17 AI literacy 
frameworks identified across all educational levels, from early childhood to university. This study reveals that 
the predominant methodologies for developing AI literacy frameworks involve empirical research studies and 
literature reviews, adhering to national government or institutional standards. These frameworks commonly 
incorporate 1) Bloom’s taxonomy or a similar progression framework, such as Use-Create-Modify, 2) con-
structionism, and 3) computer science perspectives such as theories of computation. The findings reveal that AI 
literacy is situated at the intersection of digital literacy, data literacy, computational thinking, and AI ethics, 
emphasizing the need for a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach that encompasses both technological 
and societal impacts. However, the study argues that the current paradigms of AI literacy frameworks for young 
students often emphasize constructionist perspectives without fully considering the interactions between human 
and technological agents. This gap highlights the necessity for a new conceptual framework that acknowledges 
both human and non-human agents in AI literacy education for young students. The research contributes by 
conceptualizing AI literacy and guiding policymakers and curriculum designers to implement holistic AI literacy 
education for young students.
1. Introduction
The origins of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy education can be 
traced back to the pioneering work of Papert and Solomon (1971), who 
used Logo, the first programming language to control a robotic turtle, to 
engage primary school students in active learning so that they could gain 
deeper understanding of abstract computer science concepts. Drawing 
on Jean Piaget’s constructivism, which emphasizes that understanding 
is constructed through experience (Piaget, 1977), Papert advanced a 
“constructionist” approach which highlighted the importance of 
creating tangible artifacts as part of the learning process (Papert, 1980).
This constructionist approach, closely linked to the field of AI (Kahn 
& Winters, 2021), continues to influence AI literacy initiatives, where 
students are encouraged to build computational artifacts (Touretzky 
et al., 2019 & 2023), primarily by applying technical skills (Casal-Otero 
et al., 2023) for coding and programming, as a means to develop 
computational thinking (Van Brummelen et al., 2019; Williams et al., 
2019). As a result of this constructionist influence (Miao et al., 2021; 
Morales-Navarro et al., 2023), current efforts in AI literacy education for 
primary school students stress the importance of hands-on activities (Ali 
et al., 2019; Rodríguez-Garci´a et al., 2021; Shamir & Levin, 2022).
While such constructionist and constructivist approaches remain 
valuable, they are insufficient in pedagogical scope and for addressing 
the AI literacy needs of young students. Kahn and Winters (2021), for

example, argue that young learners may lack the intellectual ability to 
benefit from the constructionist approach. Others argue that many ed-
ucators overly emphasize technical skills, which limits their pedagogy 
(Deng et al., 2021). In addition, it has been claimed that constructionism 
views knowledge as only constructed within the human cognitive pro-
cess (Bandura, 1989; Frank et al., 2022), which undermines other ways 
of knowing and interacting with knowledge.
The constructionist and constructivist approaches also tend to 
overlook the transdisciplinary (Southworth et al., 2023) and interdis-
ciplinary nature of AI (Wang, 2019). AI literacy must expand beyond its 
traditional boundaries to acknowledge the transdisciplinary integration 
of diverse fields (Southworth et al., 2023), such as computer science, 
ethics, sociology, economics, and law. Acknowledging trans-
disciplinarity involves creating AI literacy education that integrates 
knowledge from diverse fields, offering students a comprehensive un-
derstanding of the impact of AI on society. Interdisciplinarity, mean-
while, promotes collaboration across these fields as well as with AI to 
tackle complex real-life challenges. This holistic approach is essential 
because AI impacts diverse aspects of society, requiring input from 
multiple disciplines to ensure that students develop not only technical 
skills but also their thinking and ethical reasoning, fostering 
well-rounded AI literacy and preparing them for future challenges 
(Stolpe & Hallstr¨om, 2024).
Despite the growing interest in AI literacy, efforts targeting young 
students remain limited (Yim & Su, 2024). According to Miao and 
Shiohira (2022), over ten countries have designed and implemented 
government-endorsed AI curricula. However, while educators have 
begun to develop various AI literacy learning theoretical frameworks to 
guide curriculum design (Chiu et al., 2024; Kandlhofer et al., 2016), 
these frameworks may overlook the needs of young students (Yim, 2023, 
pp. 65–90). Identifying relevant AI literacy learning content for young 
students is vital (Almatrafi et al., 2024; Chiu et al., 2024) for effective AI 
literacy implementation in primary school contexts.
Long and Magerko (2020) call on researchers and educators to 
expand existing frameworks in order to accommodate new findings, 
technologies, and social norms. In response, this paper aims to concep-
tualize AI literacy for young learners by identifying and analyzing 17 AI 
literacy frameworks across different educational levels. Through this 
analysis, the paper aims to design a new, intelligence-based AI literacy 
framework for primary school students.
This paper calls for a transition from a traditional humanistic to a 
post-humanistic approach in AI literacy education by introducing a new 
intelligence-based framework that incorporates AI thinking, designed 
specifically for primary school settings. The proposed framework in this 
study defines AI literacy in the primary school context and provides 
guidance for educators to design and implement AI education curricula. 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to offer a comprehensive 
overview of existing AI literacy frameworks and to design an AI literacy 
theoretical framework specifically for young students.
2. Literature review
2.1. What is AI and AI literacy
AI gained prominence through the work of John Mc Carthy (2006), 
an American mathematician and computer scientist. Mc Carthy initially 
defined AI as “the science and engineering of creating intelligent de-
vices, particularly intelligent computer programmes” (Mc Carthy 2006, 
p.2). Over time, AI has come to be broadly recognised as computational 
systems and toolsets (Southworth et al., 2023), evolving from 
problem-solving challenges to the automation of human actions and 
cognition. Wang (2019) argues that there is no widely accepted defini-
tion of AI due to the fact that “AI” has been used to refer to a wide range 
of phenomena both within the professional AI community and the 
general public.
AI has become ubiquitous in various domains, including social media 
(Wu et al., 2019), education (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019), and 
healthcare (Jiang et al., 2017). Its application has also extended to ac-
ademic institutions, including the implementation of automatic grading 
systems and intelligent tutoring systems (Kahn & Winters, 2021). 
However, AI poses risks to society and raises questions concerning its 
ethical, social, and economic implications (Floridi et al., 2021). With the 
increasing number of young students who have grown up engaging with 
AI technologies (Ali et al., 2019) such as SIRI and Chat GPT, it is 
important to educate them regarding AI’s underlying mechanisms (Miao 
& Shiohira, 2022), while also informing them about data justice, in-
clusive data, the accuracy of AI information (Pedro et al., 2019), and the 
societal and ethical implications of AI (Miao et al., 2021). Educators 
have advocated the inclusion of AI literacy education for young stu-
dents, upholding its importance not only for computer scientists (Ng 
et al., 2021) but also for the social good in general (Floridi et al., 2021). 
Despite interactions with AI, many young students lack foundational 
knowledge regarding AI’s core technologies, mechanisms (Casal-Otero 
et al., 2024; Chiu et al., 2024), and ethical concerns (Han et al., 2024). 
This underscores the necessity to incorporate AI ethics within AI literacy 
education (Chiu et al., 2024).
Many academics believe that teaching AI literacy is a global strategy 
for digital citizenship education (Yim & Su, 2024). Indeed, AI literacy 
has evolved from digital, data, and scientific literacy (Long and 
Magerko, 2020) into a field incorporating concepts, knowledge, skills, 
and attitudes from a variety of disciplines (Southworth et al., 2023). 
However, determining what AI literacy content is relevant to young 
students (Chiu et al., 2024) remains challenging due to a lack of a uni-
versal definition of AI (Chiu & Sanusi, 2024).
2.2. AI literacy primary school education
AI literacy education was previously primarily taught at universities 
and secondary schools (Su & Yang, 2024), but has recently expanded to 
primary schools. As more age-appropriate learning tools have been 
developed (Yim & Su, 2024), more researchers have used various 
educational tools such as teachable machines (Toivonen et al., 2020), 
block-based programming such as Scratch (Dai, 2024), creativity tasks 
and tools (Williams et al., 2024), as well as the use of Generative AI 
(Jauhiainen & Guerra, 2023) to scaffold AI literacy knowledge and 
concepts to primary school students. However, there have been limited 
studies exploring what to teach young students and how to assess their 
learning outcomes (Chiu & Sanusi, 2024; Yau et al., 2023).
Researchers have recently designed various AI literacy learning 
frameworks (Chiu et al., 2024) for adults and university and K-12 stu-
dents. These include Long and Magerko’s (2020) “AI Literacy Frame-
work” for students and the general public, Southworth et al.’s (2023)
“UF (University of Florida) AI Across the Curriculum Model” for uni-
versity students, and Touretzky et al.’s (2019) “Five Big AI Ideas” 
framework for K12 students. However, very little has been developed 
specifically for primary school education. In addition, the main frame-
works emphasize technical knowledge from the perspective of higher 
education (Chiu et al., 2024), engineering (Chiu et al., 2021; Kong et al., 
2022), computer science (Van Brummelen et al., 2019), making them 
inappropriate for use with primary school students without a technical 
and computer science background. Despite the pivotal role of primary 
education as a formal and foundational learning stage (UNESCO, 2005), 
the introduction of AI literacy is crucial. It helps to build foundational 
conceptual understanding and skills (Chiu et al., 2024), preparing stu-
dents for future learning and careers (Li, 2022; OECD, 2023). Addi-
tionally, it bridges the digital divide, ensuring that all students, 
regardless of their background (Luckin & Holmes, 2016), have access to 
AI literacy. However, the development of an AI literacy learning 
framework specifically targeting primary school students remains 
largely unexplored.

3. Research aims and questions
Research indicates that recent developments in age-appropriate AI 
learning tools have extended AI literacy to primary schools, but AI lit-
eracy frameworks in this setting remain underdeveloped. Previous 
literature demonstrates that there is a need for AI literacy education for 
primary school students, but little is known about what AI is and what 
existing AI learning frameworks have been established for its imple-
mentation among this specific group of students. To address this gap, 
this study examines the conceptual understanding of AI literacy within 
existing AI learning theoretical frameworks, with the aim of proposing 
an AI literacy framework for primary school students. Four research 
questions are formulated as follows. 
RQ1 How many studies on AI literacy learning frameworks have been 
published and which educational levels have they addressed?
RQ2 What are the underlying methodologies and theoretical orienta-
tions to learning employed in the selected theoretical frameworks 
for AI literacy education?
RQ3 What are the themes regarding AI literacy within the identified AI 
literacy frameworks at each educational level?
RQ4 What are the learning focuses identified in the selected AI literacy 
theoretical frameworks?
4. Methodology
This section provides an overview of the article search and analysis 
strategy implemented by this study, influenced by the methodological 
guidance of Arksey and O’malley (2005). This review has followed the 
PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses) Statement approach (Page et al., 2021), and has been 
conducted in three stages: (1) article selection, (2) article screening, and 
(3) data coding, extraction, and analysis.
4.1. Article selection
To ensure that the article search identified quality, evidence-based 
literature, four credible citation index databases, ACM, IEEE, Scopus, 
and Web of Science, were used. Two selection criteria were applied: (1) 
that the selected studies were peer-reviewed journal articles or confer-
ence papers from the aforementioned databases; and (2) that they were 
relevant to the terms “AI literacy”, “conceptual”, “framework”, and 
“design considerations”. The search strings reflect the specific require-
ment to identify target articles and data as of the end of March 2024, as 
shown in Table 1.
4.2. Eligible criteria and the snowball method
As shown in Fig. 1, a total of 1550 articles were identified, 226 from 
ACM, 169 from IEEE, 452 from Web of Science, and 703 from Scopus. 
The inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed articles written in English, 
covering all educational levels where AI literacy is taught, namely early 
childhood, primary, secondary, and university, and higher education. 
The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies that were excluded by 
title and abstract (n = 1498); (2) duplicate studies (n = 9); and (3) 
studies that were irrelevant to the research topic (n = 27). For example, 
the empirical research studies by Yau et al. (2022) and Sinha et al. 
(2023), as well as the discussion paper by Su and Yang (2023), were 
removed because they examined the AI4K12 Five Big Ideas framework 
(AI4K12, 2024), which was already represented by the other articles 
selected for this review. Li et al. (2022) were excluded since their 
research discussed a chatbot-server framework to facilitate online 
learning using crowdsourcing data, which is a topic unrelated to AI 
literacy learning content. A systematic review by Bond et al. (2024) and 
a critical review by Luo (2024) about Gen AI policies in higher education 
assessment were also removed because they did not discuss AI literacy 
frameworks for teaching students AI literacy. Therefore, 16 studies were 
selected.
To enhance the systematic search for relevant literature, a non- 
probability snowball sampling method, as outlined by Parker et al. 
(2019), was adopted to research the chain references from the selected 
studies. Utilising this method led to the identification of three additional 
articles that met the eligibility criteria described above.
A total of 19 articles were selected and reviewed, with 17 AI literacy 
frameworks identified. The research for most of these articles took place 
in Hong Kong (N = 7), the United States (N = 6), and Germany (N = 2). 
The others were conducted in Austria, Italy, Ireland, and the United 
Kingdom. The number of frameworks is lower than the number of arti-
cles since four articles were intrinsically linked by their use of two 
frameworks, the Five Big Ideas framework and the affective, behavioral, 
cognitive and ethical (ABCE) learning framework, each providing 
complementary insights that led to a broader and deeper understanding 
of their frameworks. For example, Touretzky et al. (2019) initially 
proposed the Five Big Ideas framework and invited researchers to pro-
vide feedback and views. Subsequently, Touretzky et al. (2023) offered a 
detailed elaboration. Similarly, Ng et al. (2023) introduced the ABCE 
learning framework, and a subsequent paper by Ng et al. (2024) vali-
dated an AI literacy assessment questionnaire based on this ABCE 
framework. Thus, both articles were included in this review to capture 
the full development and application of the frameworks discussed.
4.3. Data charting and collation
All of the included articles were initially coded by the author of this 
paper. To ensure the reliability of the coding process, two independent 
researchers were engaged: one coded approximately 25% of the data 
(five articles), and the other coded an additional 35% (seven articles), 
resulting in 60% of the data being independently verified. The infor-
mation about the theoretical orientations and underlying methodolo-
gies, themes, arguments, and elements, as well as the learning focus 
regarding AI literacy within the identified AI literacy frameworks at 
each educational level, was entered separately in a table (Table 2). To

author and the two independent researchers were then compared, 
reviewed, and discussed, which led to necessary revisions of the tables.
5. Findings
RQ1 How many studies on AI literacy learning frameworks have 
been published and which educational levels have they 
addressed?
The first article, published in 2016, aimed to equip individuals with 
AI literacy across all educational levels. Between 2019 and 2022, six 
articles were published, with a peak of ten articles in 2023 (see Fig. 2). 
During the year 2023, AI literacy frameworks were specifically designed 
for various educational levels: university (Kong et al., 2023; Southworth 
et al., 2023), secondary (Ng et al., 2023, 2024), primary (Mott et al., 
2023), early childhood (Su & Yang, 2023), and K-12 grade (Touretzky 
et al., 2023; Waite et al., 2023). AI literacy frameworks were also 
designed for citizens irrespective of formal educational settings (Quille 
et al., 2022). This indicates that AI literacy has grown in importance and 
has been integrated at various educational stages.

year of publication, the AI literacy framework they address, and the 
educational levels they focus on. Out of the 17 AI literacy frameworks, 
five focus on all educational levels, four focus on K-12 contexts (i.e., 
kindergarten to secondary school), four on university and higher edu-
cation, three on secondary schools, and one on early childhood educa-
tion (ECE). 
RQ2 What are the underlying methodologies and theoretical 
orientations to learning employed in the selected theoretical 
frameworks for AI literacy education?
Underlying methodologies refer to the specific research methods and 
techniques used by the selected articles to collect and analyze data for 
the design and development of their AI literacy frameworks. Among the 
19 selected articles, 17 frameworks are identified (Table 4). The most 
common methodologies employed in the framework formulation were 
empirical research studies (n = 7) and literature review studies (n = 4), 
and some articles followed government or institutional standards (n =
4).
Several researchers constructed their frameworks based on empirical 
research data collection (N = 7). Ten´orio and Romeike(2023) built their 
AI competencies framework for non-computer science students by 
interviewing 17 multidisciplinary professionals with experience in AI 
competencies in undergraduate education. Also, Kong et al. (2023)
involved 82 university students in two AI literacy courses, consisting of 
7 h of machine learning and 9 h of deep learning. Mott et al. (2023)
interviewed 21 fifth-grade students in their study. Similarly, based on a 
study of 128 secondary students who took part in an 18-h AI course in 
machine learning and deep learning, Kong et al. (2024) used their 
empirical evidence to develop the four dimensions of their AI literacy 
framework: cognitive, metacognitive, affective, and social. In addition, 
Ng et al. (2023 a & c) developed and validated an AI literacy ques-
tionnaire based on the ABCE learning framework by conducting a pilot 
study of 363 secondary students from two different schools in Hong 
Kong.
While many of the articles employed empirical studies to inform the 
development of their frameworks, some involved systematically 
reviewing and synthesising existing research related to AI literacy (N =
4). For example, Long and Magerko (2020) conducted a literature re-
view of 150 interdisciplinary studies on AI literacy between 2000 and 
2019 and proposed an AI literacy framework with 17 competencies and 
13 considerations for individuals seeking AI literacy. Ng et al. (2021b) 
proposed their AI literacy technological pedagogical and content 
knowledge (TPACK) framework based on a literature review of 30 
peer-reviewed AI literacy articles addressing K-12 to higher education 
levels between 2014 and 2020. Similarly, Waite et al. (2023) derived 
their AI learning levels framework (SEAME), and suggested learning 
resources for each level, based on online and literature evidence, such as 
Google web searches for AI learning resources and five previous litera-
ture reviews (i.e., Arksey and O’malley, 2005; Long & Magerko, 2020; 
Sanusi et al., 2021; Giannakos et al., 2020; Marques et al., 2020) be-
tween 2005 and 2022.
On the other hand, a small number of the studies developed their 
frameworks based on the benchmarks and standards set by government 
bodies or authoritative institutions (N = 4), to ensure alignment with 
regulatory requirements. For example, the Five Big Ideas framework of 
Touretzky et al. (2019 & 2023) identified learning content based on 
Computer Science Teachers Association’s (CSTA) K-12 Computer Sci-
ence Standards, Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and Com-
mon Core standards. Schüller (2022), meanwhile, followed the Institute 
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard for digital in-
telligence when designing her AI literacy framework.

Underlying theoretical orientations to learning refer to the theo-
retical concepts and theories that guide the design and development of 
the AI literacy frameworks in the selected articles. As shown in Table 5, 
nine articles explicitly or implicitly stated their underlying theoretical 
orientations in their framework formulation. The search results indicate 
that some studies used Bloom’s taxonomy or similar scaffolding learning 
progressions (N = 4) as frameworks for developing cognitive classifi-
cation systems aimed at designing AI literacy learning objectives. Ng 
et al. (2021), for example, adopted Bloom’s taxonomy to address the 
lack of a structured cognitive classification system for AI literacy among 
educators. They highlighted that a clear framework for categorizing 
cognitive processes related to AI learning has not yet been established. 
According to Ng et al. (2021), Bloom’s taxonomy, with its hierarchy of 
educational objectives “Know and Understand AI”, “Use and Apply AI ”, 
and “Evaluate and create AI”, can be used to serve as a foundational 
pedagogical theory, aid in defining learning objectives, and support the 
development of AI literacy curricula. Similarly, Mott et al. (2023)
adopted a Use-Modify-Create learning progression framework to scaf-
fold students’ AI literacy learning. Southworth et al. (2023) adapted Ng 
et al.’s (2021) Bloom Taxonomy concept in order to develop their Uni-
versity of Florida (UF) AI Literacy Model.
In addition, some studies employed constructionism (N = 4) as a 
pedagogical approach emphasizing hands-on learning. For example, the 
Five Big Ideas framework draws upon constructionist principles to 
emphasize model building, experimentation, and the creation of 
computational artifacts for K-12 students to learn AI literacy (Touretzky 
et al., 2023). Subsequently, Su and Yang (2023) modified the Five Big 
Ideas framework proposed by Touretzky et al. (2019), to construct their 
Five Big Ideas for ECE [early childhood education]. Lastly, one study 
applied the theory of computation to explore the mathematical and 
logical foundations of AI literacy learning (Kandlhofer et al., 2016).
Meanwhile, Bloom’s taxonomy is an educational framework to 
classify learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity. Ng 
et al. (2021) employed such a hierarchical approach to categorize 
various levels of cognitive processes integral to AI literacy learning. This 
categorization encompassed not only the cognitive stages of “Know and 
Understand”, “Use and Apply”, and “Evaluate and Create”, but also 
extends to the interdisciplinary dimension of “AI ethics” in K-12 and 
higher education contexts. Southworth et al. (2023) developed their 
own University of Florida (UF) AI Literacy Model, which was modified 
based on Bloom’s Taxonomy as presented by Ng et al. (2021).
In addition, one of the first AI literacy frameworks, the “AI Curric-
ulum Framework”, was designed by Kandlhofer et al. (2016) based on 
the theory of computation, based on an undergraduate textbook auth-
ored by Russell and Norvig (2010) and exploring the mathematical and 
logical foundations of computation for students interested in AI. 
RQ3 What are the themes regarding AI literacy within the iden-
tified AI literacy frameworks at each educational level?
The themes refer to the main topics, central argument and over-
arching elements emphasized within the identified AI literacy frame-
works at each educational level are shown in Table 6. To summarize, AI 
literacy frameworks at the university level traditionally focused on the 
technical aspects of AI within computer science and engineering, but 
they have more recently expanded to include interdisciplinary collabo-
ration and ethical considerations to prepare students for the multifac-
eted challenges they will encounter in future careers. In contrast, at the 
K-12 level, older school students benefit from frameworks that 
encourage critical thinking and problem-solving in real-world contexts, 
allowing them to explore the societal and ethical impacts of AI in their 
daily life. For younger students, AI literacy emphasizes a basic concep-
tual understanding of AI and ethical awareness through creative peda-
gogies over mere technical proficiency. For instance, storytelling, and 
robotics are used, and how machines learn for early years and primary 
school students, as this engages their imagination, creativity, and

thinking in an accessible and age-appropriate manner.
5.1. Across all educational levels
Five of the frameworks in the selected studies were addressed both to 
individuals with an interest in AI literacy learning and academic spe-
cialists across all educational levels. Each of these five frameworks 
argued that AI literacy originated as a branch of computer science 
(Kandlhofer et al., 2016), emphasizing its inclusion of crucial technical 
skills, such as digital literacy (Quille et al., 2022) and data literacy 
(Schüller (2022). Long and Magerko (2020) specifically highlight the 
necessity of an operational definition of AI literacy, which they present 
as crucial for its design and practical application.
For example, Kandlhofer et al. (2016) argued that teaching compu-
tational models is pivotal for enabling students to understand the prin-
ciples behind AI algorithms and AI systems and preparing them for 
future careers in science and engineering. Hence, their proposed 
framework comprises seven computer science and computational 
thinking perspectives: 1) automata; 2) intelligent agents; 3) graphs and 
data structures; 4) sorting; 5) problem-solving by search; 6) classic 
planning; and 7) machine learning.
Meanwhile, frameworks such as the “Digital Competence Framework 
for Citizens” (Quille et al., 2022) postulate that digital competency is 
integral to AI literacy, encompassing a range of skills from information 
and media literacy to digital content creation, problem solving, and the 
responsible use of AI. Similarly, Schüller (2022) detailed the vital role of 
data within the Hochschulforum Digitalisierung (HFD) data literacy 
framework, covering the entire process of ethically handling data as well 
as decision-making with data.
Ng et al. (2021), on the other hand, elaborated that AI literacy ex-
tends beyond digital literacy, and should emphasize the cognitive 
learning aspects of knowledge acquisition, use and application, along-
side considerations of AI ethics, within their AI literacy TPACK 
framework.
5.2. University level
At university level, AI literacy frameworks have traditionally been 
anchored in the fields of computer science and engineering, and have 
later incorporated an affective and socio-cultural dimension to reflect 
the transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary nature of AI. For example, 
Southworth et al. (2023) modified the AI Literacy TPACK Framework 
(Ng et al., 2021) by adding a new construct, “Enabling AI”, aimed at 
nurturing interdisciplinary engagement. This enhancement facilitated 
the incorporation of disciplines such as programming and statistics into 
AI literacy, suggesting that AI education should not be confined to 
computer science and electrical and computer engineering departments 
alone but integrated across all curricula at the University of Florida.
Similarly, Kong et al. (2023a) argued that focusing solely on the 
cognitive domain (AI concepts) is insufficient. They proposed the in-
clusion of affective (i.e., meaningfulness, impactfulness, creative self- 
efficacy, and AI self-efficacy) and socio-cultural (i.e., ethical aware-
ness) dimensions through project work, ensuring inclusivity and 
comprehensive educational outcomes. Furthermore, Ten´orio and 
Romeike(2023) argued that the current AI literacy frameworks, pri-
marily designed from a computer science perspective, may not 
adequately serve non-computer-science students. To democratize AI 
literacy so that it can be acquired by students regardless of their tech-
nical proficiency, they proposed an AI competencies framework that 
includes nine elements (including basic AI, machine learning, and 
responsible AI) tailored to students from diverse academic backgrounds. 
This holistic approach highlights the need for AI literacy education to 
adapt to the multifaceted and evolving landscape of AI, ensuring in-
clusivity and comprehensive educational outcomes.
5.3. K-12 level
Four frameworks targeting K-12 students have been developed 
within the domain of computer science and engineering, with each of-
fering a distinct approach for building an early foundational under-
standing of AI. For example, the Five Big Ideas framework by Touretzky 
et al. (2019 & 2023) provided a structured guideline focusing on ma-
chine learning and the ethical use of AI within K-12 settings, encom-
passing key topics such as perception, representation, and societal 
impacts.
Additionally, Van Brummelen et al. (2019) demonstrated the feasi-
bility of adapting complex AI and computational thinking concepts from 
Brennan and Resnick’s (2012) computational thinking framework 
(which involves classification, prediction, and generation). Whereas 
Brennan and Resnick’s (2012) framework involved classification, pre-
diction, and generation data, Van Brummelen et al.’s (2019) adaptation 
involved integrating AI-related processes, such as training, validating, 
testing, and evaluation, thereby integrating AI concepts into established 
educational models, particularly for teaching computational thinking in 
K12 AI literacy learning.
Conversely, referring to K-12 engineering education while reflecting 
on the wide use and impact of AI, Chiu et al. (2021) developed an AKIEE 
Curriculum Framework encompassing (1) awareness, 2) knowledge, 3) 
interaction, 4) empowerment, and 5) ethics (AKIEE), advocating an AI 
literacy approach that prioritises ethical consideration, critical thinking, 
and creativity over mere proficiency in technical skills such as coding or 
robotics.
5.4. Secondary, primary, and ECE levels
Some researchers recognised the necessity to modify existing AI lit-
eracy frameworks to suit different educational levels, from ECE to sec-
ondary education, ensuring that these frameworks are developmentally 
appropriate and relevant.
For secondary students, Ng et al. (2023a & 2023b) developed the 
affective, behavioral, cognitive and ethical (ABCE) learning framework, 
building on the cognitive aspects of the AI literacy TPACK framework 
(Ng et al., 2021). This new framework emphasizes not just knowledge 
acquisition of the technological aspects of AI but also of its affective, 
behavioural, and ethical applications, reflecting a holistic approach to 
AI education. Similarly, Kong et al. (2024) emphasize the value in 
adopting a project-based approach when teaching AI literacy to sec-
ondary students, to cultivate problem-solving skills to address

real-world problems.
In ECE and primary school education, traditional frameworks are 
used and modified with different strategies to introduce AI concepts to 
young students. Mott et al. (2023) leverage the existing educational 
progression framework of “Use-Modify and Create” by suggesting 
game-based learning for primary school students, thus improving 
engagement and effectiveness in teaching AI planning concepts through 
interactive and problem-solving activities.
On a different note, Su and Yang (2023) argue that the traditional 
Five Big Ideas framework for K-12 students might not adequately align 
with the developmental and cognitive capabilities of students aged 2–6 
years. They propose a modification so that the framework not only teach 
how machines perceive the world and learn from data, but also employs 
story-telling and robotics to better suit the abilities of preschoolers. 
RQ4 What are the learning focuses identified in the selected AI 
literacy theoretical frameworks?
As shown in Table 7, this study reveals that the 19 selected articles 
express, explicitly and implicitly, five learning focuses: AI ethics (n =
13), computational thinking (n = 8), digital literacy (n = 7), data lit-
eracy (n = 7), and interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary content 
knowledge (n = 6).
AI ethics (n¼13): AI ethics is a critical construct of AI literacy that 
many researchers advocate integrating into AI literacy education to 
enhance responsible AI development and usage for all students regard-
less of their educational level. For example, Touretzky et al. (2023)
emphasize understanding the human role in AI, particularly the 
importance of recognizing the role humans play in the actions and re-
actions of AI (i.e., how the human decisions made in AI development 
affect the behaviour of AI). They argue for AI literacy education on the 
ethical principles concerning the human role in AI, particularly the 
ethics of data usage, emphasizing privacy concerns and the detection 
and mitigation of bias in datasets. These issues are central to their “Big 
Idea Three (Learning)” and “Big Idea Five (Societal Impact)”. Similarly, 
Kong et al. (2023b) highlight the sociocultural impact of AI, addressing 
ethical issues such as human autonomy under AI, the beneficence of AI, 
and the fairness of AI. Chiu et al. (2021) also contribute by suggesting 
that AI literacy should foster ethical use of AI, promote social good, and 
help students understand AI’s potential to transform the future of work. 
Moreove r, Quille et al. (2022) underline the importance of teaching AI 
principles ethically, lawfully, and robustly to both students and 
educators.
Computational thinking (n¼8): Computational thinking encom-
passes problem-solving skills and logical reasoning, focusing on the 
integration of computing with physical artifacts to help students develop 
AI literacy (Ten´orio and Romeike, 2023). As AI agents are program-
mable, Van Brummelen et al. (2019) advocate the inclusion of compu-
tational concepts, practices, and perspectives that more effectively 
capture the technical skills and competencies necessary to raise stu-
dents’ understanding of AI. At the university level, Ten´orio and Romeike 
(2023) emphasize traditional computation skills, such as coding and 
understanding data structure. At the K-12 level, researchers such as 
Touretzky et al. (2023) suggest that students not only learn about AI 
theoretically, but engage practically by creating computational artifacts 
or performing hands-on activities that apply AI concepts in their 
learning. Waite et al. (2023) suggest that students can explore AI ap-
plications at the “application” level of their SEAME framework, which 
involves engaging with IT applications that incorporate AI components, 
without necessarily delving into the details of how the underlying AI 
training models function. The “application” level serves as an entry 
point for students to engage with AI, setting the stage for deeper 
exploration, in subsequent learning activities, of the underlying models 
(M level) and the social and ethical implications (SE level). Resources 
like Scratch provide an accessible entry point into the world of pro-
gramming and can allow students to use, amend, or build AI 
applications.
Digital literacy (n¼7): Digital literacy is widely recognised as a 
foundational element for AI literacy. Long and Magerko (2020)
emphasize that “individuals need to understand how to use computers to 
make sense of AI” (p.2). While digital literacy is not explicitly named as 
one of the Five Big Ideas (Touretzky et al. (2023), the skills and 
knowledge associated with digital literacy are embedded within the 
AI4K12 initiative. Their Big Idea One (Perception), Big Idea Two (Rep-
resentation and Reasoning), and Big Idea Three (Learning) require stu-
dents to learn how AI perceives the world, analyzes information, draws 
conclusions, and makes decisions based on information—and in order 
for students to understand these AI processes, they must possess a 
certain degree of digital literacy. Ten´orio and Romeike(2023) further 
elaborate that AI literacy extends digital literacy by demanding not only 
understanding but also the critical application of AI technologies.
Data literacy (n¼7): Understanding how computers learn from data 
is fundamental to AI literacy (Touretzky et al., 2023). Machine learning 
algorithms, such as decision trees and neural networks, adjust their

internal logic to improve reasoning based on data input (Touretzky 
et al., 2019 & 2023).Touretzky et al.’s (2023) Big Idea Three (Learning) 
indicates that machine learning is a kind of statistical inference that 
finds patterns in data.Waite et al. (2023) state that AI literacy encom-
passes not only AI models but also data science in their training pro-
cesses, including machine learning paradigms (i.e., supervised, 
unsupervised, and reinforcement learning). These all necessitate the 
sourcing and preparing of data for model training, involving data col-
lecting, cleaning, classifying, visualising, and testing. Highlighting the 
importance of data, Long and Magerko (2020) argue that data literacy is 
crucial, particularly in the subfield of machine learning, to developing 
effective AI systems. Schüller (2022) advocates a multidisciplinary 
approach to teaching data literacy, incorporating three main perspec-
tives: “application-oriented” (i.e., how to use data in real-world situa-
tions), “technical methodological” (i.e., the technical competency 
necessary to handle and analyze data effectively). and “socio-cultural” 
(i.e., the social, cultural, and ethical implications of data). She argues 
that this comprehensive approach not only enhances individual com-
petency but also benefits society as a whole (Schüller, 2022).
Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary content knowledge 
(n¼6): AI literacy extends beyond traditional academic boundaries, 
incorporating interdisciplinary (Chiu et al., 2021; Schüller, 2022; 
Ten´orio & Romeike, 2023) and transdisciplinary approaches (Long and 
Magerko, 2020; Southworth et al., 2024). An interdisciplinary approach 
to AI literacy education involves integrating concepts and methods from 
multiple disciplines to enhance the understanding and application of AI. 
For example, Schüller (2022) emphasizes incorporating computer sci-
ence and related fields into AI literacy education, viewing AI as part of a 
broader data ecosystem. Chiu et al. (2021) likewise consider AI to be 
interdisciplinary in nature, highlighting the importance of engineering 
and computer science as foundational disciplines. Second, a trans-
disciplinary approach goes beyond combining disciplines to create new 
approaches that transcend traditional boundaries but also connect 
learning to human needs and real-world challenges. This approach is 
particularly important in the development of AI machines (Long ang 
Magerko, 2020), as it permits numerous ways to conceptualize and 
create AI by drawing on diverse fields of knowledge. Southworth et al. 
(2023) emphasize that understanding AI requires more than knowledge 
of isolated technologies; it demands a holistic comprehension spanning 
multiple disciplines. Indeed, AI literacy has been regarded as entailing a 
holistic understanding of AI for transdisciplinary inquiry to solve com-
plex problems in life and learning (Southworth et al., 2023), as well as to 
encourage responsible societal engagement (Long and Magerko, 2020). 
Similarly, Biagini et al. (2024) postulate that teaching and assessing AI 
literacy should move beyond the narrow scope of computer science and 
engineering to embrace not only the knowledge-based (e.g., knowing 
how AI works) and operational dimensions (e.g., using AI concepts and 
applications in various contexts), but also critical (e.g., applying AI to 
improve critical thinking) and ethical dimension (e.g., considering jus-
tice, responsibility, openness, ethics, and safety).
6. Discussion
First, this study reveals that 17 AI literacy frameworks have been 
developed across all educational levels, from early childhood to uni-
versity, confirming the growing significance of AI literacy education. 
This is consistent with Yim and Su (2024)’s recent review, which argues 
that AI literacy is no longer limited to computer scientists but has been 
expanded to encompass a wider audience, including young students 
without a computing or technical background (Chiu et al., 2024; Long & 
Magerko, 2019).
Second, the predominant methodologies used in developing AI lit-
eracy frameworks primarily involve empirical research studies and 
literature reviews, often guided by national government or institutional 
standards. These frameworks commonly incorporate Bloom’s taxonomy 
or similar cognitive scaffolding progressions, constructionism, and 
computer science perspectives, such as theories of computation. The 
findings of this study are aligned with the UNESCO report that 
constructionist and constructivist approaches are dominant in AI liter-
acy K-12 education settings (Miao & Shiohira, 2022; Relmasira et al., 
2023). In K-12 contexts, researchers have also tended to adopt 
constructionist principles and focus on cognitive domains, which 
emphasize “learning by doing” (Touretzky et al., 2019 & 2023).
Third, this study confirms the finding of previous reviews that 
computational thinking and data literacy have been a key focus of AI 
literacy education (Casal-Otero et al., 2023; Rizvi et al., 2023; Yue et al., 
2022). This aligns with Andries and Robertson’s (2023) recommenda-
tion that basic machine learning concepts should be taught along with 
algorithmic thinking in computer science education and AI literacy. In 
its consideration of the 17 AI learning frameworks, this study finds that 
the concept of AI literacy has been situated at the intersection of digital 
literacy (i.e., using computational devices), data literacy (i.e., data 
labelling, modelling, and evaluation, and analyzing and arguing with 
data), and computational thinking (i.e., using code to communicate 
ideas). This focus of the existing frameworks is rooted in the belief that, 
given the inherent relationship between AI and computers, students 
should acquire digital literacy (Long and Magerko, 2020) and computer 
and data science knowledge in their AI literacy learning (Casal-Otero 
et al., 2023; Rizvi et al., 2023; Yim & Su, 2024). Furthermore, these 
frameworks predominantly focus on the acquisition of knowledge and 
technical skills to prepare students for future AI-driven environments 
(Almatrafi et al., 2024; Casal-Otero et al., 2023), and contain limited 
focus on empowering them with the agency to think critically and on 
fostering a creative and innovative mindset in AI literacy learning.
Fourth, this study’s findings reveal that, while AI literacy frame-
works have tended to focus on the fields of computer science and en-
gineering, the approach to teaching AI literacy at university level has 
progressively evolved to embrace multidimensional perspectives. This 
shift reflects a recognition of the interdisciplinary nature of AI, sug-
gesting that higher education is adapting to the complexities of AI 
technological development. This transition is paralleled in K-12, where 
AI literacy frameworks emphasize a cognitive and constructionist base, 
while integrating AI ethical considerations from an early age.
Consistent with the reviews of Almatrafi et al. (2024) and Casal-O-
tero et al. (2023), this study reveals that AI ethics has recently become a 
focus of most AI literacy frameworks for young students. These frame-
works have used varied terminology to refer to AI ethics, such as “AI 
ethical learning” (Chiu et al., 2021; Ng et al., 2023; Southworth et al., 
2023), “socio-ethics” (Waite et al., 2023), “social-cultural” (Kong et al., 
2023), “social awareness” (Kong et al., 2024), “responsible AI” 
(Romeike et al., 2024), and “societal impact” (Touretzky et al., 2019 & 
2023). This focus on ethics creates the need for a transdisciplinary and 
interdisciplinary approach to AI literacy, one which encompasses an 
understanding of both technology and its societal impacts.
7. A proposed intelligence-based AI literacy framework for 
young students
This review has identified several research gaps. First, the current 
paradigm of AI literacy education for young students is deeply rooted in 
Piaget’s constructivist and Papert’s constructionist perspectives, which 
focus on developmental stages and cognitive growth as primarily indi-
vidual and internal human processes. While many existing AI literacy 
frameworks have been instrumental in defining the stages of cognitive 
readiness, they have not sufficiently accounted for the impact of socially 
and technologically mediated interactions on the development of 
cognition (Cole & Wertsch, 1996). The inherently transdisciplinary na-
ture of AI demands a more expansive educational framework that goes 
beyond the current priority to acquire knowledge and skills such as 
digital literacy, computational thinking, data literacy, and AI ethics.
Second, teaching students to acquire knowledge and skills alone is 
not sufficient, since knowledge and skills are highly vulnerable to 
I.H. Yue Yim

obsolescence given the fast-paced technological development of modern 
society (Li, 2022; OECD, 2023). AI literacy education should therefore 
focus not only on students’ acquisition of computational and other 
technical skills, but also on fostering adaptability and thinking with AI 
technology to solve novel problems. In AI literacy, students need crea-
tive and cognitive thinking skills alongside computational thinking and 
data literacy skills. For instance, Long et al. (2023) use family activities 
to illustrate AI literacy concepts (e.g., knowledge representations and 
machine learning) to parents and children and engage them in building 
machine-learning models at home. They later transform these technical 
activities into interactive museum exhibits, showing how creativity can 
enhance AI literacy in informal settings. This transformation illustrates 
the vital role of creative thinking in rendering AI literacy learning ex-
periences more engaging, relevant, and impactful in real-life settings.
Similarly, Williams et al. (2024) developed Doodlebot, an interactive 
tool that fosters not only students’ understanding of technical algo-
rithms but also their creative collaboration with AI machines. Their 
study highlights the importance of creative thinking in developing AI 
literacy. As Steve Jobs once stated, “It is in Apple’s DNA that technology 
alone is not enough—it’s technology married with liberal arts, married 
with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our hearts sing” 
(Dediu, 2011). The i Phone’s integration of AI exemplifies how AI 
technology combined with human creative thinking leads to in-
novations. Humanity relies on innovation and the creation of knowledge 
to solve novel problems (Green et al., 2010). Collaboration with human 
creativity is a prerequisite for generating innovative solutions via AI to 
address real-life challenges. Education should empower students with 
the competency to collaborate with technologies to solve novel prob-
lems and thereby contribute to humanity’s future wellbeing (OECD, 
2023). Viewing AI merely as a replication of human cognition over-
simplifies its complexities and overlooks the dynamic interactions that 
occur between humans and non-human (e.g., technological) entities.
Furthermore, AI literacy education, with its strongly constructionist 
basis, tends to reflect a technological determinism (Poel, 2020) that 
assumes a linear and predetermined progression of AI development 
shaped solely by its internal logic. This approach does not sufficiently 
consider the dynamics of human-technological interaction, thereby 
revealing a significant gap in how AI literacy is currently taught. This 
gap points to the necessity for a revised conceptual framework for AI 
literacy learning that more accurately acknowledges and reflects the 
role of both humans and non-humans. Teaching AI only through the lens 
of computer science may offer technical solutions, but also encourage a 
narrow focus regarding the role of AI and its risks. For example, it may 
not adequately address human influence over dataset training and how 
the process of datafication can introduce bias and other associated 
problems (Benjamin, 2019) (such as those which Google confronted in 
2018, when its AI algorithms mistakenly tagged black people as “go-
rillas” in Google image searches due to dataset inadequacies uninten-
tionally introduced by humans (Google, 2018)). Without a broader 
interdisciplinary approach, AI literacy may risk overlooking the possible 
societal impacts of AI technology.
Knowledge infrastructures consist of the networks of people, ma-
chines, artifacts, and institutions that generate, share, and maintain 
knowledge about the world (Frank et al., 2022). However, the existing 
knowledge base often struggles to address the complex realities of our 
evolving technological landscape (Carrillo & Koch, 2021). An anthro-
pocentric perspective which regards knowledge as constructed solely in 
the human mind may limit the comprehension of these emerging 
knowledge infrastructures. In contrast, post-humanism encourages 
moving beyond an anthropocentric view, recognizing both human and 
non-human actors as co-creators of knowledge (Barad, 2007; Braidotti, 
2019). In the age of the technosphere, combined with the development 
of AI and machine learning, knowledge and decision-making are no 
longer solely the domain of humans (Herrmann-Pillath, 2018). The in-
fluence of AI extends far beyond simple localized computational func-
tions, and plays a significant role in societal applications, such as 
surveillance systems using facial recognition in smart cities to manage 
traffic and prevent crime (Yigitcanlar et al., 2020), and in tracking 
contacts for Covid-19 detection (Agbehadji et al., 2020). In other words, 
AI is not merely a piece of technology but a dynamic participant in the 
broader processes of societal and educational evolution (Watson & 
Romic, 2023), representing a partnership between humans and ma-
chines in co-constructing the world (Benjamin, 2020). Thus this study 
invites researchers and educators in the field of AI literacy education to 
move away from the anthropocentric mindset and recognize the role of 
all agents, human and non-human, in the construction of knowledge.
In terms of teaching AI ethics, this study recommends a holistic 
approach allowing students to examine questions from differing angles 
and thus develop a more comprehensive ethical consideration of AI. For 
example, philosophy can encourage students to explore moral di-
lemmas, such as whether AI systems should prioritize certain human 
values and how responsibility is shared in AI decision-making. In eco-
nomics, students can evaluate AI’s impact on labor markets, income 
inequality, and resource distribution, considering how AI might both 
contribute to and mitigate economic disparities. In law, students can 
investigate accountability, privacy, and regulation, exploring how legal 
frameworks can ensure that AI systems respect human rights and comply 
with existing laws. Finally, regarding ecology, students can learn how AI 
could be leveraged to protect and manage natural resources and balance 
technological innovation with environmental sustainability. This inter-
disciplinary approach can help students develop a more comprehensive 
understanding of AI’s ethical implications.
7.1. The conceptual framework for the “AI literacy intelligence-based 
framework”
This paper defines AI thinking as a novel manifestation of thinking, 
resulting from the amalgamation of human cognition with human and 
artificial intelligence. This unique cognitive entity comes into existence 
through human interaction and collaboration with AI, giving rise to a 
new agent and cognitive entity. In short, AI thinking is characterized by 
cognitive thinking, creative thinking, and analysis from different per-
spectives, having regard to social, ethical, and environmental 
considerations.
Building on the social-cultural perspectives of Lev Vygotsky (Amineh 
and Asl, 2015), this study proposes a new post-humanistic AI literacy 
framework that incorporates “AI thinking”, a transdisciplinary approach 
that includes ethical, cognitive, and creative engagement with AI tech-
nologies. This framework is designed to empower young students with

agency, particularly in primary school settings, to effectively learn AI 
literacy.
As shown in Fig. 3, the proposed framework aims to advance equality 
and inclusiveness, by integrating AI thinking into AI literacy learning 
frameworks. By recognizing young students’ level of cognitive devel-
opment (Piaget, 2000) and moving away from a heavy focus on the 
technical aspects of AI, the proposed framework would be a means to 
include more early education learners in AI literacy education. Primary 
school education is the foundational stage that shapes future learning 
trajectories (Membrive et al., 2022) and ethical perspectives (Alawneh 
et al., 2024). As a result, fostering AI literacy at this stage can promote 
more equitable access to technology education and nurture responsible 
AI engagement from an early age.
Young students are central to a view of education that emphasizes 
human agency, where individuals are seen as the primary drivers of 
change (Duoblien˙e et al., 2023; OECD, 2019). Since primary school 
students are at a crucial stage of their cognitive development (Piaget, 
2000), where they develop core skills such as literacy, numeracy, and 
cognitive thinking (OECD, 2019), the integration of AI literacy into their 
education can help them learn not only how to use AI but also to 
contribute to its future development ethically and responsibly. By 
empowering students with AI thinking from an early age, this study aims 
to prepare them to become not only AI consumers but also AI producers 
in the global AI community of the future.
7.2. Limitations of current educational paradigms and frameworks in AI 
literacy education
This proposal begins with a discussion on the nature of cognition, 
particularly comparing the “proximal locus of development” of Jean 
Piaget and Lev Vygotsky, and delving into their contrasting views on 
how cognitive development occurs in individuals (Cole & Wertsch, 
1996). Jean Piaget’s cognitive and constructivist views posit that 
learning and cognitive development involve specific developmental 
“ages and stages” (Amineh and Asl, 2015), where new personal expe-
riences disrupt existing cognitive structures, leading to a state of 
disequilibrium (i.e., new knowledge creating conflicting ideas and 
feelings in the human mind). To regain equilibrium, children adapt their 
thinking through processes of assimilation (i.e., fitting the new infor-
mation into what already know) and accommodation (i.e., changing the 
existing knowledge to accommodate new knowledge), by restructuring 
their present knowledge to higher-order thinking (Piaget, 1977).
While foundational and valuable, this view can be limiting in the 
context of AI literacy education, where learning and thinking is not only 
about individual adaptation but also interacting with and through 
technology. Furthermore, while constructionism builds on construc-
tivism and recognizes the role of technology in learning (Papert & Harel, 
1991), it views thinking as an attribute of individuals, as a property of 
individual brains, rather than an integral part of cognitive processes 
(Wegerif, 2002). Although this view acknowledges technology, such as 
the computer, as “an object to think with”, it does not conceptualize 
thinking as mediated by technology.
7.3. Theoretical underpinning for an intelligence-based AI literacy 
framework
In contrast, Lev Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory provides a more 
comprehensive understanding of cognition (Kozulin, 2003), and can 
therefore play a crucial role in informing the design of an inclusive AI 
literacy framework. His notion of mediation explains that thinking and 
cognitive development are significantly influenced by social interactions 
and cultural tools (Wertsch, 2003). This perspective suggests that 
thinking is not merely an individual construct but is contextually spe-
cific and mediated by cultural tools (Robbins, 2005), while intelligence 
is also not solely a biological property (Cole & Derry, 2005). This is 
particularly relevant in today’s technological context, in which scholars 
such as Wegerif (2002) and Mc Luhan (2023) emphasize technology as 
an integral cultural system that mediates human learning and cognition.
Cole and Derry (2005) explore this relationship, arguing that the 
development of technology both shapes and is shaped by human 
cognitive processes, indicating a reciprocal relationship between tech-
nology and human intelligence. This duality indicates that technology is 
not only a result of human intelligence but also a catalyst for advancing 
human cognitive abilities and intelligence. For AI literacy, this means 
recognizing technology’s dual role in both enhancing task efficiency and 
enriching cognitive processes. This comprehensive view supports a more 
integrated AI literacy framework that views AI as an active participant in 
the cognitive development of students, moving beyond its traditional 
role as a mere tool and acknowledging its deeper impact on expanding 
human cognitive capacities.
As “Learning occurs when biological organisms join together with 
technology to form a larger self-organising systems” (Wegerif & Major, 
2024, p. 197), Cole and Derry (2005) call for an interdisciplinary 
collaboration, involving humans and technology, that would permit the 
discovery of transformative solutions to effectively address real-life 
challenges. “Thinking skills” refer to teaching mental processes that 
include not only how to acquire knowledge, but also “learning to learn” 
effectively (Wegerif, 2006). The ability to leverage AI computational 
power and data processing abilities in tandem with human creativity, 
intuition, and ethical reasoning (Nebreda et al., 2024) open up possi-
bilities to enhance individuals’ thinking skills (Wegerif & Major, 2024, 
p. 121) and creative potential (Lubart, 2018). Therefore, this study ar-
gues that the inclusion of AI thinking—the human-AI cognitive proc-
ess—is an effective way to learn AI literacy (Fig. 4).
8. Research implications: transitioning to an intelligence-based 
AI literacy framework
This study proposes a shift from a traditional knowledge and skills 
acquisition approach to a more dynamic, intelligence-based framework 
for AI literacy that incorporates AI thinking to transcend the existing 
boundaries of knowledge. It agrees with Wegerif and Major (2024, p. 
121) that educational technology can be used to expand knowledge by 
enabling students to engage with new and unforeseen challenges, as well 
as address existing ones.
In the context of environmental degradation (Zalasiewicz et al., 
2011) and the urgent need for education on sustainability, this study 
highlights the importance of collaboration between humans and AI and 
the introduction of human values and ethical and societal considerations

into the design of AI technology. Environmental challenges cannot be 
addressed by AI alone, or humans alone.
AI systems are often perceived as objective due to their binary nature 
(0s and 1s) and their ability to uncover universal laws and structures 
underlying observable phenomena (Mc Carty, 2024). This perception of 
objectivity is misleading because human involvement in data selection 
and algorithm design inherently introduces biases (Benjamin, 2020). As 
a result, AI systems can propagate these biases, leading to ethical issues 
and reinforcing existing inequalities (Mc Carty, 2024). Integrating the AI 
thinking into AI literacy education may address inherent data biases and 
ethical issues, thereby harnessing the potential of AI for the benefit of all 
humans, non-humans, and the environment. This intelligence-based 
framework promotes a deeper understanding of AI literacy, encour-
aging students to collaborate effectively with AI in cognitive and crea-
tive thinking. Moreover, it encourages students to engage cognitively, 
creatively, and ethically with AI technology, fostering a more inclusive 
and sustainable future.
9. Conclusion and limitations
This study argues that constructivist/constructionist and human 
cognitive approaches alone may not fully enable students of AI literacy 
education to understand critical issues such as data injustice and the 
ethical and societal impact of AI. It adds that, although there is a variety 
of theoretical frameworks for AI literacy education for adults, university 
students, and students within K-12 contexts, there has been limited focus 
on primary school students. This paper adds to existing research by 
providing educators and researchers with a new intelligence-based AI 
literacy framework for students in primary school contexts, one which 
broadens students’ thinking by including both human and non-human 
elements in their AI literacy education.
The study also contributes to existing research by conceptualizing AI 
literacy and informing policymakers and curriculum designers of a new 
way of implementing a holistic, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary 
AI literacy education program. In addition, the study seeks to empower 
primary students by transforming them from AI consumers to AI pro-
ducers, so that they may fully explore their potential in AI literacy 
learning. It is hoped that this intelligence-based AI literacy framework 
will serve as a valuable resource for researchers and educators seeking to 
introduce AI literacy to primary school students. Ultimately, the adop-
tion of this framework is expected to lay the groundwork for a more 
comprehensive and inclusive approach to AI literacy education in pri-
mary schools.
The limitations of this study must also be acknowledged. Given that 
it was conducted using only four major citation index databases, some 
relevant studies may have been overlooked. Expanding the research to 
include additional databases, especially those focusing on interdisci-
plinary studies or emerging technologies, could yield a broader range of 
insights. Another limitation is the subjective nature of interpretation and 
coding of the data. While 60% of the data was independently verified by 
three coders, this process would have been strengthened by indepen-
dently verifying the full dataset. It is hoped that this study will 
encourage future studies to explore these possibilities.
The success and refinement of this new framework will depend 
heavily on subsequent empirical research studies. It is essential for 
future research to test this framework’s principles, providing data that 
can validate, refute, or refine the foundational concepts proposed in this 
study. To effectively implement AI literacy education for future gener-
ations, it is crucial to explore educators’ and teachers’ readiness to teach 
AI literacy, their challenges, as well as their professional development 
requirements.
