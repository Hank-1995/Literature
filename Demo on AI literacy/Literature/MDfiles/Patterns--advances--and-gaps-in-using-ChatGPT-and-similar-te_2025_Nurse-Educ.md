Background and aim: Generative AI (Gen AI) can transform nursing education and modernise content delivery. 
However, the rapid integration of these tools has raised concerns about academic integrity and teaching quality. 
Previous reviews have either looked broadly at artificial intelligence or focused narrowly on single tools like 
Chat GPT. This scoping review uses a structured framework to identify patterns, advances, gaps, evidence, and 
recommendations for implementing Gen AI in nursing education.
Methods: This scoping review followed the JBI methodology and PRISMA-Sc R guidelines. We searched Pub Med, 
CINAHL, SCOPUS, ERIC, and grey literature (October to November 2024). Data synthesis utilised the PAGER 
framework as a mapping tool to organise and describe patterns, advances, gaps, evidence for practice, and 
recommendations.
Results: Analysis of 107 studies revealed Gen AI implementation across four key domains: assessment and eval-
uation, clinical simulation, educational content development, and faculty/student support. Three distinct 
implementation patterns emerged: restrictive, integrative, and hybrid approaches, with hybrid models demon-
strating superior adoption outcomes. Technical advances showed significant improvement from GPT-3.5 (75.3 % 
accuracy) to GPT-4 (88.67 % accuracy) in NCLEX-style assessments, with enhanced capabilities in multilingual 
assessment, clinical scenario generation, and adaptive content creation. Major gaps included limited methodo-
logical rigour (29.0 % of empirical studies), inconsistent quality control, verification challenges, equity concerns, 
and inadequate faculty training. Geographic distribution showed North American (42.1 %) and Asian (29.9 %) 
dominance, with Chat GPT representing 83.2 % of tool implementations. Key recommendations include devel-
oping institutional policies, establishing quality verification protocols, enhancing faculty training programs, and 
addressing digital equity concerns to optimise Gen AI integration in nursing education.
Conclusions: Gen AI has transformative potential in nursing education. To realise its full potential and ensure 
responsible use, research should focus on developing standardised governance frameworks, empirically vali-
dating outcomes, developing faculty in AI literacy, and improving technical infrastructure for low-income 
contexts. Such efforts should involve international collaboration, highlighting the importance of the audi-
ence's role in the global healthcare community.

1. Introduction
Healthcare education is undergoing rapid transformation through 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Alowais et al., 2023; Wang and Li, 2024). 
Within this broader field, Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) 
emerges as a specialised branch capable of creating new content in text, 
image, and simulation formats (Chiarello et al., 2024; Zubiaga, 2024). 
Large language models (LLMs) represent a key subset of Gen AI, using 
vast datasets to generate human-like text responses (Law, 2024). 
Throughout this review, we use Gen AI as an umbrella term encom-
passing these related technologies transforming nursing education (Yun 
et al., 2024).
In nursing education, Gen AI is being used to simulate clinical sce-
narios, support academic writing, and deliver tailored feedback (Lifshits 
and Rosenberg, 2024). These applications suggest new ways to engage 
students and extend teaching resources. At the same time, concerns have 
been raised about misinformation (‘hallucination’), embedded bias, and 
the risk of weakening core nursing values such as empathy and ethical 
reasoning (Laizure, 2024; Shiferaw et al., 2024). As use increases, the 
literature has expanded through editorials, exploratory studies, and 
pilot implementations. However, a coherent synthesis of this emerging 
evidence is lacking. This gap raises important questions: How are 
nursing programs currently implementing Gen AI? What evidence sup-
ports these approaches? What implementation patterns show promise? 
This scoping review addresses these questions by systematically map-
ping the evidence landscape using a structured framework.
2. Background and rationale
A few reviews have begun to examine Gen AI in nursing education, 
but most lack structured analytical frameworks for systematically 
mapping evidence into actionable insights. Abujaber et al. (2023) used 
SWOT analysis to identify strengths and threats associated with 
Chat GPT without mapping implementation patterns across educational 
contexts. Gunawan et al. (2024) employed text network analysis to 
identify thematic clusters without tracking evidence progression. 
Hobensack et al. (2024) focused on bibliometric trends rather than 
synthesising implementation strategies. Without frameworks to organise 
findings into patterns, advances, gaps, evidence, and recommendations, 
the evidence remains fragmented and challenging to translate into 
practical guidance.
Despite their distinct educational implications, many scoping re-
views do not differentiate Gen AI from broader AI technologies. Unlike 
traditional AI applications for clinical decision support (Khosravi et al., 
2024), Gen AI tools generate original content in real time, enabling 
adaptive simulations, dialogue-based learning, and automated feedback 
(Chen et al., 2024). These capabilities raise unique pedagogical and 
ethical considerations for nursing education. However, reviews like 
Montejo et al. (2024) and El Arab et al. (2025) discuss AI broadly 
without focusing on Gen AI's interactive, generative functions, over-
looking implementation questions specific to nursing education.
Most evaluations focus on earlier versions like Chat GPT-3.5 (Kleib 
et al., 2024), despite newer models showing marked improvements. Wu 
et al. (2024) report that GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 by over 13 per-
centage points in nursing assessment tasks, a differential with practical 
implications for formative assessment and personalised learning. Exist-
ing reviews, thus, may not provide timely guidance for educators 
adapting newer, more capable Gen AI tools.
Despite comprehensive search strategies, reviews have reported low 
study yields; Kleib et al. (2024) identified only 17 studies across eight 
databases, while Yalcinkaya and Yucel (2024) included just 15 articles. 
This reflects the field's recency and the dissemination of innovations 
through commentaries or practice reflections, which are not consistently 
indexed in academic databases. Early reviews appropriately relied on 
opinion pieces and grey literature to document initial responses to 
Gen AI (Hobensack et al., 2024). As the field matures, systematically 
mapping emerging empirical work becomes increasingly important.
Existing reviews have highlighted methodological heterogeneity (El 
Arab et al., 2025), lack of evaluation standards (Gerdes et al., 2024), and 
limited real-world implementation evidence (Montejo et al., 2024). 
Ethical concerns are commonly raised, but few reviews propose risk 
management strategies (Liu et al., 2023). This scoping review addresses 
these limitations by applying the PAGER framework (Bradbury-Jones 
et al., 2022) to organise findings across five domains: Patterns of 
implementation, Advances in capabilities, Gaps in knowledge, Evidence 
from practice, and Recommendations for development. This structured 
approach enables educators to assess Gen AI's current state and future 
direction in nursing education, supporting evidence-based decisions 
about its responsible integration.
3. Aim and review questions
This scoping review examines how Gen AI tools such as Chat GPT are 
implemented in nursing education. It seeks to identify common imple-
mentation patterns, document technological advances, highlight gaps in 
current evidence, summarise practice-based findings, and propose rec-
ommendations for responsible integration. The review applies the 
PAGER framework to structure the synthesis across five domains: Pat-
terns, Advances, Gaps, Evidence, and Recommendations. To guide the 
review, the following questions were developed: 
1. What patterns emerge in how Gen AI are discussed, studied and 
applied in nursing education?
2. What advances have been made in Gen AI technology and its appli-
cations in nursing education?
3. What gaps exist in current knowledge and practice regarding Gen AI 
use and integration?
4. What types of evidence exist regarding the use and outcomes of 
Gen AI in nursing education?
5. What recommendations can be made to integrate Gen AI in nursing 
education successfully?
4. Methodology
4.1. Design
We followed the JBI methodology for scoping reviews (Peters et al., 
2020) to map and synthesise evidence on Gen AI in nursing education. A 
protocol was registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) registry 
(doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/PNUE8). The methodological change to the 
protocol involved the inclusion of the PAGER framework as a structured 
mapping tool to organise and describe the available evidence in this 
emerging field. This framework was specifically selected to provide 
systematic, actionable insights and identify knowledge gaps in Gen AI's 
complex and rapidly evolving landscape (Bradbury-Jones et al., 2022). 
The complete review process and findings are reported following the 
PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-Sc R) reporting 
guidelines (Tricco et al., 2018) (Supplementary material 1).
4.2. Eligibility criteria and study types
This scoping review followed the JBI PCC (Population, Concept, 
Context) framework to guide inclusion and exclusion criteria. We 
included studies of all types, such as research articles and opinion pieces, 
that examined the use or discussion of Gen AI tools (Concept), including 
Chat GPT, Claude, and Perplexity, in nursing education settings 
(Context). Eligible studies involved nursing students, faculty, or re-
searchers (Population). We included only English-language publica-
tions published between November 2022 and November 2024. Studies 
focusing on general AI, non-Gen AI chatbots, or clinical practice outside 
educational settings were excluded.

4.3. Search strategy and information sources
From October 2024 to November 2024, we searched Pub Med, 
CINAHL, SCOPUS, ERIC, and grey literature (Google Scholar). Initial 
searches in Pub Med informed the development of a comprehensive 
search strategy adapted for each database (Appendix 1). Reference lists 
of included studies were hand-searched for additional relevant articles.
4.4. Screening
Citations were imported into Covidence® software for duplicate 
removal and systematic screening. Six reviewers (EE, DC, EK, AJF, MD, 
KS) independently assessed titles and abstracts against inclusion criteria. 
This multi-reviewer approach was implemented to manage the sub-
stantial volume of citations while enhancing the identification of rele-
vant studies through diverse expertise. Full-text articles were then 
evaluated by the same reviewers, with two senior reviewers (SB, SG) 
resolving disagreements through discussion and consensus. Regular 
calibration meetings ensured consistent application of inclusion criteria 
across all reviewers. The selection process followed PRISMA-Sc R 
guidelines and is documented in the accompanying flow diagram 
(Tricco et al., 2018).
4.5. Data extraction
Data extraction was conducted using Covidence systematic review 
software, which enabled blinded screening and automated conflict res-
olution. Six reviewers (EE, DC, EK, AJF, MD, KS) independently 
extracted data using a custom form structured around the review 
questions and PAGER framework elements, covering bibliometric data, 
methodology, findings, challenges, recommendations, and PAGER 
components. The form was piloted with 10 random papers and refined to 
include theoretical frameworks, expanded outcomes, and supporting 
quotes. Regular calibration meetings ensured consistency, with dis-
agreements resolved through consensus using Covidence's conflict res-
olution feature. Data quality was verified through random spot-checking 
of 20 % of the extracted data.
4.6. Quality appraisal
Given the heterogeneous nature of the included articles and per 
scoping review guidelines (Peters et al., 2020), a quality appraisal was 
not conducted.
4.7. Data analysis
Data analysis followed the PAGER framework (Bradbury-Jones et al., 
2022), employing systematic synthesis. Data were organised in stand-
ardised templates and cross-checked for accuracy. The iterative analysis 
identified Patterns in themes, Advances in knowledge, Gaps in current 
understanding, Evidence for practice, and Recommendations. Team 
meetings and analytical memos documented decision-making processes, 
while cross-validation between reviewers ensured interpretative rigour. 
The synthesis underwent multiple refinements to maintain methodo-
logical transparency, including: (1) development of preliminary the-
matic matrices followed by team consolidation of overlapping concepts; 
(2) standardisation of coding frameworks across all PAGER elements; (3) 
systematic verification of synthesised findings against source data; and 
(4) documentation of analytical decision points where interpretations 
diverged, with final categorisation determined through consensus.
4.8. Data presentation
Results are presented in multiple formats: a PRISMA flow diagram 
detailing the selection of studies, comprehensive tables illustrating study 
characteristics, and systematic synthesis using the PAGER framework. 
The PAGER framework structures the findings through thematic 
matrices mapping Patterns and Advances across six key domains with 
supporting evidence and quotes, structured tables presenting Gaps 
across five categories with representative quotes and study identifiers, 
Evidence for practice organised by six key areas with supporting study 
data, and detailed tables linking Recommendations to specific themes 
and evidence. The synthesis includes an integrated summary table 
aligning findings across PAGER elements, with all components sup-
ported by direct quotes and study identifiers to ensure analytical rigour 
and transparency.
5. Findings
5.1. Selection of studies
The review identified 4787 references through database and grey 
literature searching. After removing 2289 duplicates, the remaining 
2498 records were screened by title and abstract. Of these, 2262 records 
were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 235 
full-text articles were retrieved and assessed for eligibility. A further 128 
studies were excluded for not focusing on nursing education (n = 50), 
being studies involving non-nursing professionals (n = 21), unclear 
descriptions of Gen AI's role (n = 20), and lack of relevance to Gen AI (n 
= 17). Other reasons for exclusion included publication in non-English 
languages (n = 11), reviews or commentaries lacking primary findings 
(n = 7), and the unavailability of full text (n = 2). One hundred and 
seven (107) studies met the eligibility criteria (Fig. 1).
5.2. Characteristics of included studies
Table 1 summarises the characteristics of the included studies. Sixty- 
two (62, 57.9 %) studies were published in 2024, while 45 (42.1 %) were 
published in 2023. Most publications were commentaries, editorials, or 
opinion pieces (39, 36.4 %), followed by original research and educa-
tional innovation studies (34, 31.8 %). Other publication types included 
letters to the editor and correspondence (18, 16.8 %), reviews, and 
special articles (16, 15.0 %). Geographically, most publications origi-
nated from North America (45, 42.1 %), followed by Asia (32, 29.9 %), 
Europe (11, 10.3 %), and Oceania (4, 3.7 %). Only one study (0.9 %) 
came from Africa, while 14 (13.1 %) were international collaborations. 
Regarding Gen AI tools implemented, Chat GPT dominated (89, 83.2 %), 
with varying version specifications (GPT-3.5: 31, GPT-4: 17, unspeci-
fied: 41), while other tools were minimally represented (DALL-E: 6, 
Bard/Gemini: 4, Claude: 3). The focus areas of the publications included 
educational applications (82, 76.6 %), implementation strategies (48, 
44.9 %), ethical considerations (45, 42.1 %), assessment methods (38, 
35.5 %), technical aspects (32, 29.9 %), and policy or guidelines (25, 
23.4 %). Methodologically, the studies were predominantly theoretical 
or conceptual (42, 39.3 %), with practice-based (34, 31.7 %) and 
empirical studies (31, 29.0 %) also well-represented. (Supplementary 
material 2: Detailed characteristics of included studies).
5.3. Patterns in Gen AI use in nursing education and research
Our analysis identified six interrelated patterns in Gen AI use in 
nursing education (see Table 2 and Supplementary Table S3.1). 
Assessment and evaluation emerged as the primary pattern, with faculty 
using Gen AI to generate NCLEX-style questions and provide automated 
student feedback (Li et al., 2024; Stamm, 2024; Teubner et al., 2023). 
Despite varying accuracy rates across versions (Hsu, 2023), these tools 
demonstrated value in creating diverse assessment formats across mul-
tiple studies (Cox et al., 2023; Huang and Tan, 2023; Kaneda et al., 2023; 
Parker et al., 2023; Seney et al., 2023a; Su et al., 2024a; Vaughn et al., 
2024; Krueger et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Taira et al., 2023)
Simulation development constituted another significant pattern, 
particularly in mental health and paediatric scenario creation. Building

on basic scenarios, integration with text-to-speech technologies 
enhanced simulation authenticity (Reed and Dodson, 2024), thereby 
improving communication practice opportunities in several contexts 
(Benfatah et al., 2024; Jung, 2023; Sharma and Sharma, 2023; Sharp-
nack, 2024). Complementing these applications, educational content 
creation through teaching materials and case studies formed another 
prominent pattern (Bumbach, 2024; Irwin et al., 2023; O'Connor, 2023a; 
Maykut et al., 2024; O'Connor et al., 2024), where faculty combined 
visual tools with Gen AI-generated content to produce comprehensive 
clinical narratives and course materials (Bumbach, 2024; Harrison, 
2024; Thakur et al., 2023; Musallam et al., 2024a,b; Quattrini et al., 
2024; Draganic, 2023; Elting and Desio, 2024; Foronda and Porter, 
2024; Krueger et al., 2024; Musallam et al., 2024a,b; O'Connor, 2023b; 
Quattrini et al., 2024; Reed and Dodson, 2024; Simms, 2024a,b; Stamm, 
2024).
Notable differences emerged in usage patterns between faculty and 
students. While faculty focused on content preparation, assessment 
development, and quality control (Bumbach, 2024; Cox et al., 2023; 
Irwin et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Thakur et al., 2023), with an emphasis 
on content oversight (Sessions and Ness, 2024), students utilised Gen AI 
primarily 
for 
exam 
preparation 
and 
self-directed 
learning 
(Kowitlawakul et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023; Elting and Desio, 2024;

Simms, 2024b), leveraging cognitive scaffolding for complex tasks 
(Turchioe et al., 2024).
Beyond these user-specific patterns, the review identified three 
distinct implementation approaches: 1) restrictive, 2) integrative, and 3) 
hybrid. Restrictive approaches limit Gen AI use, particularly in assess-
ments, emphasising verification requirements and traditional skill 
development (Alkhaqani, 2023b; Choi et al., 2023). Integrative imple-
mentations actively incorporate Gen AI as a learning tool with structured 
guidelines for practical use and critical evaluation (Archibald and Clark, 
2023; Baker Stein and Jones-Schenk, 2024). Hybrid approaches enable 
Gen AI in specific learning activities while restricting it in others, 
employing verification protocols and clear boundaries for appropriate 
use (Miao and Ahn, 2023; Riley, 2024; Kleebayoon and Wiwanitkit, 
2023; Lim, 2023; Nashwan and Abu Jaber, 2023; Teixeira da Silva and 
Tsigaris, 2024).
5.4. Advances in Gen AI applications in nursing education
The review identified advances in Gen AI's technical capabilities and 
educational applications (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S3.2). 
Newer Gen AI versions demonstrated improved accuracy rates across 
multiple studies (Hallas, 2023; Huang, 2023; Hyewon et al., 2024; 
Kaneda et al., 2023; Kelly, 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Metersky et al., 2024; 
Ni et al., 2024; Su et al., 2024b). Most notably, GPT-4 achieved an 88.67 
% accuracy rate in NCLEX-style questions, compared to GPT-3.5's 75.3 
%, with Wu et al. (2024, p. 4) confirming that “Chat GPT 4.0 had an 
accuracy rate of 88.67% when answering NCLEX-RN MCQs.” Beyond 
accuracy improvements, studies also reported enhanced multilingual 
capabilities and integration with speech technologies (Taira et al., 2023; 
Ye, 2024).
The review further identified improvement in educational content 
development, from basic text generation to more sophisticated appli-
cations. Shu-Ling (2024, p. 1) described this evolution as creating con-
tent that “provides students with a more effective and interactive 
learning experience.” Building on this trend, several studies documented 
improved scenario-generation capabilities and depth of educational 
materials (Bumbach, 2024; Irwin et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; O'Connor 
et al., 2023). Similarly, assessment tools progressed from simple ques-
tions to context-specific evaluation instruments with enhanced feedback 
mechanisms and explanation quality (Sun, 2024), ultimately enabling 
more varied and practical assessment formats (Cox et al., 2023; Huang, 
2023; Kaneda et al., 2023).
Student and faculty support systems demonstrated notable evolu-
tion, with distinct but parallel advances in both areas. For students, 
studies documented improved personalisation and self-directed learning 
capabilities, where Gen AI functions as cognitive scaffolding that helps 
“students advance towards the performance of complex tasks” (Turchioe 
et al., 2024, p. 4; Huang, 2023; Kowitlawakul et al., 2024; Liu et al., 
2023). Complementing these student-focused advances, research also 
described faculty support tools evolving into teaching assistance systems 
with advanced feedback generation (Alqahtani et al., 2023), though 
with the important caveat that “faculty must carefully evaluate and 
revise the Chat GPT 3.5 output before student use” (Sessions and Ness, 
2024, p. 1; Bumbach, 2024; Cox et al., 2023; Irwin et al., 2023).
5.5. Gaps in Gen AI applications in nursing education and research
The review identified significant methodological, conceptual, and 
practical gaps (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S3.3). Studies report-
ing Gen AI heavily relied on non-empirical sources with limited long- 
term investigations. Primary studies featured small sample sizes and 
lacked standardised evaluation methods (Bers¸e et al., 2023; Hsu and 
Chen, 2024; Parker et al., 2023; Rusandi et al., 2023). The key con-
ceptual gap was insufficient integration with established pedagogical 
frameworks and unclear definitions of Gen AI roles in education 
(Castonguay et al., 2023; Shepherd and Griesheimer, 2024; Sun, 2024; 
Teixeira da Silva, 2023; Topaz et al., 2024).
Implementation barriers included privacy concerns and academic 
dishonesty risks (Sun, 2023), with students potentially using Gen AI to 
complete assignments rather than develop original work (Thakur et al., 
2023). Limited hands-on evaluation methods and overreliance risks 
further challenge effective implementation (Abujaber et al., 2023; 
Alkhaqani, 2023b; Srinivasan et al., 2024; Vitorino and Júnior, 2023). 
Equity gaps emerged through digital access disparities and language 
barriers, with a concerning concentration of studies in high-income 
settings creating knowledge deficits in low-resource contexts (Jung, 
2023; Alkhaqani, 2023a; Reed, 2023; Summers et al., 2024; Vitorino and 
Júnior, 2023).
Technical challenges included inconsistent accuracy and training 
data biases, with Gen AI models processing information in ways difficult 
to interpret (Wu et al., 2024, p. 3). Integration difficulties and system 
compatibility issues added complexity to implementation (Shay, 2023; 
Tran et al., 2024). Quality assurance gaps included a lack of verification 
standards and risks of generating inaccurate content, requiring stringent 
controls and validation protocols (Shay, 2023; Summers et al., 2024; 
Thakur et al., 2023; Vitorino and Júnior, 2023).
5.6. Evidence for practice in Gen AI applications in nursing education

and comprehensive explanations for all answer options. Moreover, 
studies highlighted GPT-4's multilingual capabilities and advanced 
feedback mechanisms that address diverse learning needs (Cox et al., 
2023; Huang, 2023; Kaneda et al., 2023; Parker et al., 2023).
Gen AI demonstrates improved training quality in clinical simulation 
through advanced integration of text-to-speech and speech-to-text 
technologies. Such integration enhances simulation realism by 
creating more authentic patient interactions and enabling personalised 
educational opportunities (Reed and Dodson, 2024; Bumbach et al., 
2024; Reed et al., 2023). These benefits are particularly evident in 
mental health and paediatric scenarios, where communication skills are 
paramount (Cox et al., 2023; Jung, 2023; Sharma and Sharma, 2023; 
Sharpnack, 2024). Building on these simulation advances, educational 
content development helps reduce faculty workload while maintaining 
quality. The combination of visual tools like DALL-E with Chat GPT en-
hances content delivery, with Reid (2024) confirming Chat GPT's ca-
pacity to produce detailed clinical scenarios, while additional studies 
substantiate Gen AI's role in creating adaptive learning resources 
(Bumbach, 2024; Huh, 2023; Liu et al., 2023; O'Connor et al., 2023).

processes, though Riley (2024) emphasised that instructor review of 
Chat GPT content remains essential before distribution to students. 
Complementing faculty applications, student evidence supports cogni-
tive scaffolding effectiveness and personalised learning support 
(Bumbach, 2024; Cox et al., 2023; Huang, 2023; Irwin et al., 2023; 
Kowitlawakul et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Beyond educational settings, 
clinical applications demonstrate Gen AI's capacity to bridge theory- 
practice gaps (Alkhaqani, 2023c), with documented ability to produce 
clinically relevant material and develop task-specific reasoning skills 
(Metersky et al., 2024), while maintaining necessary oversight for 
complex scenarios (Hallas, 2023; Kaneda et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; 
Ni et al., 2024).
5.7. Recommendations for Gen AI implementation in nursing education
Several recommendations emerge from the included studies (Table 2
and Supplementary Table S3.5). Short-term training initiatives should 
focus on developing AI literacy and digital proficiency among faculty 
and students, incorporating prompt engineering as an essential curric-
ulum component (O'Connor et al., 2024). Building on this foundation, 
authors emphasise the need for content that develops critical thinking 
abilities alongside the establishment of ethical guidelines to ensure 
responsible AI use (Alkhaqani, 2023b; Archibald and Clark, 2023; 
Athilingam and He, 2024). Moving from training to curriculum design, 
studies recommend systematically integrating AI into nursing education 
while preserving traditional teaching methods, noting that such inte-
gration can strengthen student writing skills (Parker et al., 2023) while 
maintaining balance between innovation and established pedagogical 
practices through ethics and data literacy integration (Alkhaqani, 
2023a; Allen and Woodnutt, 2023; Castonguay et al., 2023; De Gagne 
et al., 2024).
Technical recommendations focus on improving Gen AI's accuracy 
and reducing bias by refining models to reflect nursing standards and 
classification systems better (Gosak et al., 2024; Ye, 2024). Com-
plementing these technical considerations, studies emphasise devel-
oping advanced features while ensuring seamless integration with 
existing educational systems (Benfatah et al., 2024; Gosak et al., 2024; 
Hsu and Chen, 2024; Jung, 2023). Beyond technical aspects, institu-
tional recommendations include developing policies and inclusive tools 
to ensure equity, access, and support for diverse user needs (Abujaber 
et al., 2023), thereby reducing language barriers and improving 
geographic access to resources (Abujaber et al., 2023; Fontenot, 2023; 
Hsu, 2023; Huh, 2023).
Policy recommendations highlight the importance of establishing 
clear standards for AI implementation through comprehensive guideline 
development with regular updates. This includes developing ethical 
protocols for AI implementation in qualitative and mixed-methods 
research (Lyon, 2023) that address academic integrity and ensure 
transparent Gen AI use (Abdulai and Hung, 2023; Abujaber et al., 2023; 
Alkhaqani, 2023a,b). Finally, research recommendations emphasise the 
need for longitudinal and outcome evaluation studies to determine the 
enduring effects of Gen AI integration (Benfatah et al., 2024; Chang 
et al., 2024; Cox et al., 2023; De Gagne et al., 2024), particularly 
focusing on how Gen AI influences students' development of ethical 
reasoning (De Gagne et al., 2024).
6. Discussion
This scoping review employed a PAGER framework to examine 
patterns, advances, gaps, evidence, and recommendations for Gen AI in 
nursing education across 107 publications. Our analysis revealed sys-
tematic patterns across five domains, with assessment generation, clin-
ical simulation and educational content development showing 
consistent adoption. Implementation approaches ranged from restrictive 
to integrative models, with faculty maintaining oversight while students 
utilised Gen AI for self-directed learning. Technical advances were 
substantial, with newer Gen AI versions demonstrating improved per-
formance and applications evolving from basic content generation to 
adaptive learning materials with enhanced simulation realism. Despite 
these advances, significant gaps persist in methodological rigour, con-
ceptual frameworks, equity considerations, and quality assurance. While 
educational applications dominated our findings, practical imple-
mentation strategies, assessment methods, and technical integration 
remain underexplored. Evidence demonstrates Gen AI's practical utility 
in assessment generation, clinical training enhancement, and faculty 
workload reduction while maintaining educational quality. Our rec-
ommendations emphasise faculty development, balanced curriculum 
integration, technical improvements, comprehensive policy frame-
works, and longitudinal research examining long-term impacts.
The geographical and thematic landscape of Gen AI publications in 
nursing education reveals important patterns that demand attention. 
While North America (42.1 %) and Asia (29.9 %) dominate the 
discourse, Africa's minimal contribution (0.9 %) and limited European 
engagement (10.3 %) signal knowledge generation disparities that could 
perpetuate global inequities in technology adoption (Hoagland and 
Kipping, 2024). Similarly, the overwhelming predominance of Chat GPT 
(83.2 % of studies) with minimal exploration of alternatives like DALL-E 
suggests a narrow technological focus that may limit understanding of 
how different Gen AI architectures could uniquely support nursing ed-
ucation. The observed geographical imbalance and limited international 
collaborations (13.1 %) may suggest emerging Gen AI implementation 
discussions that reflect well-resourced nursing education contexts. Also, 
the finding of the field's strong focus on educational applications (76.6 
%) demonstrates recognition of Gen AI's pedagogical potential. The 
relatively lower emphasis on assessment methods (35.5 %), technical 
aspects (29.9 %), and policy guidelines (23.4 %) contrasts with the 
prominent ethical considerations (42.1 %). This disparity may indicate a 
misalignment between aspirational goals and operational readiness. The 
pattern aligns with the observed early technology adoption challenges in 
nursing education during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic 
(Amankwaa et al., 2022). A balanced research agenda that bridges 
theoretical enthusiasm with robust implementation frameworks is 
needed.
The observed patterns of Gen AI use for assessment, clinical simula-
tion, and content creation reveal opportunities and gaps. While faculty 
demonstrate creative applications, the predominant reliance on con-
ceptual papers and anecdotal evidence raises fundamental questions 
about implementation efficacy (Alam and Mohanty, 2023; Asad et al., 
2021). Also, the evidence of restrictive, integrative, and hybrid imple-
mentation models (Gerdes et al., 2024) represents a significant theo-
retical advancement that requires careful consideration. Each model 
presents distinct trade-offs between innovation and control. It is 
important to interrogate their contextual appropriateness and scalability 
across different educational settings. For example, the restrictive model 
that emphasises controlled implementation may protect academic 
integrity. However, it may limit transformative learning opportunities. 
Conversely, the integrative approach's embrace of Gen AI tools risks 
reproducing educational inequities without proper safeguards.
We found significant advancements in Gen AI capabilities, with 
technical progress observed in assessment applications (GPT-4 improved 
accuracy [88.7 %] in generating NCLEX-style questions). The finding 
represents a substantial improvement over GPT -3.5 (75.3 %) in 
computational precision (Lucas et al., 2024). This advancement aligns 
with broader patterns in healthcare education, as demonstrated by Jin 
et al. (2024) meta-analysis that revealed GPT-4's significantly higher 
accuracy (64.4–100 %) compared to GPT-3.5 (36–77 %) across health 
professional licensing examinations. The observed advancements extend 
our understanding of Gen AI capabilities beyond simple automation. 
Gen AI offers sophisticated applications that can be used in clinical 
simulation and adaptive learning environments. This promises to 
enhance accessibility and personalised learning (Furey et al., 2024).
However, as noted in previous studies (Wu et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 
I. Amankwaa et al.

2024), the promising technological improvements require careful 
consideration, given the observed variations in performance across 
different healthcare education contexts (Jin et al., 2024). The variation 
in performance may indicate potential barriers to equitable adoption in 
favour of high-income, English-speaking regions (Shorey et al., 2024). 
Additionally, this variation suggests the need for discipline-specific 
validation approaches (Martzoukou et al., 2024). Studies reporting 
technical issues, training data biases, and AI system opacity (Hobensack 
et al., 2024) underscore the need for empirical validation to support 
evidence-based implementation.
Our review further showed significant advances in Gen AI's capacity 
to create adaptive learning materials and realistic simulations. The 
finding aligns with broader trends in medical education, where AI has 
supported personalised learning and context-specific training (Lucas 
et al., 2024). While technologically sophisticated, the observed in-
novations require careful alignment with established pedagogical 
frameworks to ensure meaningful learning outcomes (Shorey et al., 
2024). The findings suggest a need for structured implementation 
frameworks that address challenges in data privacy, academic integrity, 
and assessment validity (Stahl and Eke, 2024). These advances demand 
robust pedagogical oversight and systematic evaluation to ensure that 
technological capabilities genuinely enhance educational quality rather 
than merely automating existing practices.
7. Recommendations
This review identified important gaps and opportunities in support of 
Gen AI implementation to advance nursing education. The findings 
indicate the necessity of establishing a comprehensive system that bal-
ances innovation with academic integrity in nursing assessment and 
clinical training. These frameworks should establish clear data privacy 
and security standards guidelines and ensure compliance with educa-
tional regulations (Foronda and Porter, 2024). To address identified 
disparities, incentive structures should promote equitable access to 
Gen AI technologies across diverse settings, with particular attention to 
underserved populations and low-resource settings. Targeted strategies 
are needed for bridging digital divides and maximising global 
applicability.
Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the impact of Gen AI use 
on student outcomes and ethical decision-making. Comparative effec-
tiveness research between AI-enhanced and conventional teaching 
methods should be given priority. There should be efforts to ensure that 
findings are generalisable and practical across diverse educational en-
vironments. Research should focus on how Gen AI influence clinical 
reasoning, professional judgment, and academic integrity over time. 
Critical examination is required to ensure Gen AI alignment with peda-
gogical frameworks, particularly investigating impacts on critical 
thinking and reflective learning. Additionally, research must examine 
the integration of AI into didactic education and its effect on teaching 
quality.
Implementation should follow evidence-based approaches in 
assessment generation and clinical simulation development, aligning 
with established pedagogical frameworks to enhance rather than replace 
effective teaching practices. Systematic documentation and evaluation 
of implementation experiences will contribute to developing best prac-
tices. Developing technical and ethical competencies is crucial, espe-
cially for upholding academic integrity and ensuring equitable student 
access. Cross-institutional collaboration should be encouraged to share 
implementation strategies and lessons learned.
8. Limitations
Our review has several limitations. First, the prevalence of non- 
empirical publications in our included studies reflects the emerging 
nature of Gen AI in nursing education. While understandable given the 
technology's recency, this limits the availability of evidence-based 
practices and frameworks for implementation. Our reliance on tool- 
specific terms (e.g., “Chat GPT”) in our search strategy may have 
excluded certain Gen AI studies due to the evolving terminology. How-
ever, we mitigated this by including broader conceptual terms (e.g., 
“Artificial Intelligence”). The absence of standardised “generative AI” 
Me SH terms during our search period further constrained comprehen-
siveness. Future reviews should incorporate emerging controlled vo-
cabulary (e.g., 2025 Me SH updates). Our decision to exclude non- 
English publications may have overlooked valuable perspectives from 
regions leading in educational technology innovation.
9. Conclusion
Our review demonstrates Gen AI's transformative potential in nursing 
education. It has shown promise in improving assessment accuracy, 
clinical simulation sophistication, and adaptive learning capabilities. 
However, geographical disparities in research contributions and pre-
dominantly theoretical evidence base present critical challenges. The 
limited focus on practical implementation frameworks, assessment 
methods, and policy guidelines signals a pressing need for evidence- 
based integration strategies. There is a need for coordinated response 
through multi-institutional research networks, comprehensive faculty 
development programs, and robust governance frameworks aligned 
with professional nursing standards. Research efforts must focus on 
developing validated instruments for measuring AI-enhanced learning 
outcomes, establishing longitudinal studies examining pedagogical 
effectiveness, and fostering international collaboration to ensure equi-
table adoption.
