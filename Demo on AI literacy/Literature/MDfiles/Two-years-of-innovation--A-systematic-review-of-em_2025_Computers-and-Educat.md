This systematic review examines the evolution of empirical research on generative AI in language learning and 
teaching from 2023 to 2024. Following PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed 144 peer-reviewed articles from Web of 
Science, Scopus, and ERIC databases to explore the field’s progression, including identifying new developments, 
shifts in research priorities, and emerging themes that have arisen compared to the first year. The findings reveal 
an exponential growth in publications, with a significant shift from primarily exploratory inquiries to more 
systematic and empirically driven investigations. The analysis identified six main research foci: Perceptions and 
attitudes, psychological and cognitive aspects, teaching and learning strategies, language skills development, 
writing and feedback, and implementation and integration. While higher education (86.7 %) and English as 
Foreign Language contexts (86.1 %) dominated the research landscape, there was notable geographical diversity, 
with strong representation from East Asia and emerging contributions from the Middle East. Mixed-methods 
approaches (38.9 %) were prevalent, with increasing incorporation of AI-generated content, multimedia re-
cordings, and digital interaction data from 2023 to 2024. Writing emerged as the primary focus (42.4 %) while 
speaking, listening, and reading skills received comparatively less attention. This review highlights critical gaps, 
including limited research in K-12 settings, insufficient longitudinal studies, and the need for more diverse 
language representation beyond English. These findings suggest the field is maturing but requires broader 
investigation across educational levels, language domains, and geographical contexts to fully understand the 
impact of generative AI in language education.
1. Introduction
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in language education 
has been of growing interest since the turn of the millennium. AI refers 
to the capability of digital machines to perform tasks that are usually 
associated with intelligent beings (Chiu et al., 2024). Research on AI 
applications in computer-assisted language learning dates back to 1978 
(Schulze, 2008). Early AI-driven tools focused on automated feedback 
and error correction. With the advancement of natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) and machine learning, more advanced AI technologies, 
such as speech recognition, machine translation, and chatbots, have 
been used to support personalized language learning (Kuddus, 2022). 
More recently, generative AI technologies such as GPT-based models 
have gained significant popularity for their easy access and ability to 
produce sophisticated human-like text and multimodal content (Liu 
et al., 2023). Generative AI systems enable language learners to engage 
in more interactive tasks, including reading, writing, listening, speaking, 
and multimodal composing, broadening the scope of AI-assisted lan-
guage practice and language education. These advancements have 
opened new avenues for research on how AI influences both formal and 
informal language teaching and learning (Li et al., 2024b).
1.1. Artificial intelligence in language education for teaching and research 
(2000–2022)
Between 2000 and 2022, the use of AI in formal language education 
experienced significant growth (Ng et al., 2023). Unlike other technol-
ogies, such as audio and video, AI has been used to support diverse 
language learning needs, including speaking, pronunciation, writing, 
natural language processing, and personalized learning (Liang et al., 
2021). As a result of the benefits of AI in language learning, research on 
its effectiveness, benefits, and usage in language education has

increased. In their analysis of 516 papers published between 2000 and 
2019, Huang et al. (2023) identified ten major areas where AI has been 
integrated into language education: (1) automated writing evaluation, 
(2) intelligent tutoring systems for reading and writing, (3) automated 
error detection, (4) computer-mediated communication, (5) personal-
ized language learning systems, (6) natural language and vocabulary 
learning, (7) web-based language learning resources, (8) specialized 
writing intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), (9) pronunciation and speech 
training systems, and (10) tools for monitoring learners’ emotional 
states and affective responses.
Conversational AI has emerged as a significant area of research. In 
their comprehensive review, Ji et al., 2023 examined 24 empirical 
studies that explored the role of conversational AI in language educa-
tion, spanning publications from 2015 to 2021. This study examined 
basic chatbots that primarily followed predefined dialogue patterns or 
featured simple question-and-answer dialogue structures based on user 
input. Their analysis revealed five key roles these chatbots played in 
language learning: (1) a conversation partner to provide opportunities 
for speaking practice, support written conversations, and help with 
reducing foreign language anxiety and increasing willingness to 
communicate, (2) a feedback provider that offers individualized feed-
back on language production and provides adaptive feedback based on 
learner input, (3) a resource provider that presented authentic learning 
materials and support vocabulary acquisition and phonological aware-
ness, (4) an evaluator that assesses learners’ language proficiency and 
provides diagnostic information about learners’ abilities, and (5) a needs 
analyst that tailors instruction based on learners’ specific needs.
Recent reviews have documented the growing body of literature on 
AI in language education, with a sharp rise observed after 2015 (Huang 
et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2023). However, Ji et al., 2023, found a significant 
gap in their review: 75 % of studies did not clearly define the role of 
human teachers or involve them in AI-integrated language learning, 
underscoring the need for further research on human-AI collaboration in 
language education. Jeon and Lee’s (2024) systematic review compared 
human-chatbot and human-human interactions in language education, 
analyzing 64 statistical findings across 11 experimental studies. Their 
analysis revealed that while chatbots matched human performance in 
mechanical aspects such as utterance sophistication, human teachers 
were superior in social elements, including interactivity and sustaining 
long-term interest. Therefore, they proposed conceptualizing chatbots as 
novel interlocutors with unique advantages, rather than as human re-
placements. They suggest that educators leverage chatbots for me-
chanical aspects of language learning while reserving human interaction 
for social elements (Del Giglio & da Costa, 2023).
As research continues to explore these complex dynamics of AI 
integration in language education, the global research landscape itself 
has undergone significant changes. Historically, the United States (US) 
has dominated AI education research, followed by Taiwan and Japan 
(Huang et al., 2023). However, a notable shift has emerged. Since 2019, 
there has been a dramatic increase in publications from Asian nations, 
particularly China, Taiwan, and Japan, marking a significant change 
from earlier trends that predominantly featured contributions from the 
US (Alaqlobi et al., 2024).
1.2. The rise of advanced language models and AI in language education 
(2022–2024)
Advanced language models (ALMs) are sophisticated AI systems 
designed to understand and generate human language. Examples of 
ALMs include GPT-4, Google’s BERT, and Facebook’s Ro BERTa. The 
purpose of ALMs is to enhance the interaction between humans and 
machines by enabling computers to process and generate human lan-
guage in a way that is natural and meaningful. ALMs are built using deep 
learning techniques, particularly neural networks, and are trained on 
vast amounts of text data (Pattam, 2023).
The advent of Chat GPT in late 2022 marked a significant milestone 
in AI-assisted language learning, thanks to its ability to generate 
coherent and contextually relevant responses. Recent reviews (e.g., 
Alaqlobi et al., 2024; Crompton et al., 2024; Yang & Li, 2024) highlight a 
shift toward advanced AI technologies in educational settings, particu-
larly with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as 
Chat GPT in language learning. Large language models are a subset of 
ALMs, where the “large” aspect refers to their extensive training data 
and parameters. The change towards using AI technologies in education 
has led to a new phase of research focused on understanding how these 
powerful tools can be integrated into language education. For example, 
Teng (2024) and Barrot (2023) provided an in-depth analysis of 
Chat GPT’s application in writing instruction, and Law (2024) and Li 
et al. (2024b) offered a broad overview of Chat GPT in language edu-
cation. Other studies have focused on using Chat GPT for second lan-
guage learning (e.g., Yang & Li, 2024) and the exploration of Chat GPT’s 
applications in teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL) (e.g., 
Barrot, 2023; Teng, 2024). The review articles noted that the interac-
tional, psychological, and technical challenges previously identified by 
(Ji et al., 2023) have seen significant improvements.
Beyond LLMs, Generative AI (Gen AI) has emerged as a broader 
category encompassing any AI system capable of generating content, 
including text, images, and audio. As a result of its numerous benefits, 
Gen AI has emerged as a versatile tool in language education, serving in 
roles ranging from writing assistants and feedback providers to teaching 
supporters, assessment tools, and self-directed learning aids (Li et al., 
2024a; Barrot, 2023; Law, 2024; Teng, 2024). Educators and students 
have reported generally mixed attitudes toward Chat GPT (Holland & 
Ciachir, 2024), although educators have been more cautious in 
expressing concerns about potential risks (Li et al., 2024b). These 
include students’ over-reliance that could diminish creativity and crit-
ical thinking skills, the generation of inaccurate or unintelligible re-
sponses, and challenges of academic integrity due to plagiarism (Li et al., 
2024b; Law, 2024).
Gen AI technologies are not tailored to specific applications; they 
open a broad spectrum of possibilities for users to explore and employ 
creatively (Li et al., 2023a). Limited research in authentic classroom 
settings has been a methodological limitation before and until now. 
Crompton et al. (2024) noted that few studies have examined the actual 
use of Gen AI in language learning contexts. This gap may stem from the 
relative newness of these technologies and the rapid pace of techno-
logical advancements. Gen AI is relatively novel in educational contexts, 
often leading research to focus on early adoption and immediate effects 
rather than sustained impacts (Li et al., 2024b). Additionally, the swift 
evolution of AI technology can surpass the slower pace of academic 
study, resulting in fewer investigations into the latest innovations (Li 
et al., 2024b).
Li et al. (2024b) provide a comprehensive overview of the initial 
research on Chat GPT in language education, from November 2022 to 
November 2023. Their study highlighted that exploratory research was 
prominent in the field in the first year after the advent of Chat GPT. 
Before the widespread adoption of AI chatbots such as Chat GPT, access 
to such advanced tools was restricted (Li et al., 2023a). Therefore, it is 
unsurprising that there has been a phase focused on understanding how 
early adopters in education perceive and utilize Chat GPT. That being 
said, Li et al. (2024b) acknowledge that technology reviews, commonly 
referred to as media reviews in some academic publications, are an 
important component of the current research landscape on Chat GPT in 
language education. These reviews (e.g., Barrot, 2023; Carlson et al., 
2023; Topal, 2024) represent an emerging sub-genre within educational 
discourse, distinguishing themselves from traditional technology re-
views by focusing their analysis on Chat GPT’s educational affordances 
and its impact on student learning. For instance, the seminal review by 
Kohnke and Moorhouse (2023) on Chat GPT in Language Teaching and 
Learning has emerged as a foundational work in this field. Published in 
April 2023, their analysis established a framework for examining AI’s 
role in language education that continues to influence academic

discourse. The work’s significance is reflected in its extensive scholarly 
impact, garnering 489 citations as of August 15, 2024.
Recent reviews demonstrate the rapid growth of research on 
Chat GPT in language education since its release in late 2022. Reviewed 
articles have predominantly focused on Chat GPT’s application in En-
glish as a Foreign Language (EFL) context, particularly in writing in-
struction (Li et al., 2024b; Law, 2024). There has been a consistent 
emphasis on higher education settings across all reviews, indicating a 
current research bias towards university-level applications of Chat GPT 
(Li et al., 2024b; Crompton et al., 2024; Law, 2024; Teng, 2024; Yang & 
Li, 2024). Common gaps identified include the need for long-term 
studies on learning outcomes, research on K-12 applications, studies 
on languages other than English, and investigations into ethical use and 
data privacy (Li et al., 2024b; Law, 2024; Teng, 2024; Yang & Li, 2024). 
Looking ahead, the reviews suggest a shift in teaching practices, 
emphasizing the need for educators to adapt their roles, the develop-
ment of new assessment strategies, and the creation of guidelines for 
ethical AI use in language learning (Li et al., 2024b; Barrot, 2023; 
Carlson et al., 2023; Law, 2024; Teng, 2024; Topal, 2024; Yang & Li, 
2024).
1.3. What this paper adds
Generative AI represents a significant leap in AI capabilities 
compared to the systems reviewed in earlier studies and has spurred a 
substantial amount of research in a short time. There is a need to explore 
the field’s progression, including identifying new developments, shifts 
in research priorities, and emerging themes that have arisen compared 
to the first year. While initial reviews captured the exploratory nature of 
early studies on generative AI, this review examines how research has 
matured in the second year. It identifies shifts from initial exploration to 
more applied and empirical studies, both within and outside traditional 
classroom settings. By analyzing publications from both the first and 
second years, this review offers a unique comparative and comprehen-
sive perspective on how research trends, methodologies, and focus areas 
have evolved given the surge of publications. Specifically, we address 
the following research questions in this review study. 
1. What are the characteristics and development patterns of empirical 
research on generative AI in language learning and teaching, as re-
flected in: 
a. Publication trends and journal quality indicators
b. Methodological approaches and data collection methods
c. Theoretical foundations
d. Geographic and institutional representation?
2. How has generative AI been integrated into language education 
research regarding: 
a. Learning contexts (educational contexts and target languages)
b. Technological tools and implementations
c. Research focus areas?
3. What are the emerging insights and gaps in the literature, and what 
directions do they suggest for future research in generative AI for 
language education?
Through investigating these questions, this review aims to provide 
an in-depth understanding of how empirical research on generative AI in 
language education has developed since Chat GPT’s release, helping 
identify both the current state of research and critical gaps requiring 
further investigation. This systematic analysis will help researchers and 
practitioners better understand existing research efforts and guide 
future directions in integrating generative AI into language teaching and 
learning.
2. Methodology
2.1. Systematic literature review initiation
This systematic review follows the protocol established by Butler 
et al. (2016) and adheres to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines as outlined in 2015 
(PRISMA, 2015) and 2020 guidelines (Page et al., 2021).
2.1.1. Literature retrieval
Three primary databases, Web of Science (Wo S), Scopus, and ERIC 
(Education Resources Information Center), were strategically chosen for 
their extensive collections of peer-reviewed articles. The development of 
search terms and the construction of the search query were guided by 
the research questions and informed by an initial scoping review of the 
field and an examination of key papers in the domains of Gen AI and 
language learning. For each conceptual cluster, we identified a range of 
terms to capture the breadth of relevant literature. The final search 
query was constructed using Boolean operators to combine terms within 
and across the two conceptual clusters: 
(“Generative AI” OR “Gen AI” OR “Large Language Models” OR LLM* 
OR Chat GPT OR GPT* OR “AI language models” OR “Neural lan-
guage models”) AND (“Language learning” OR “Language teaching” 
OR “Second language acquisition” OR “SLA” OR “TESOL” OR “TEFL” 
OR “ESL” OR “EFL” OR “Foreign language instruction” OR “Lan-
guage pedagogy” OR “Language instruction” OR “Foreign language”)
We employed a two-round systematic search strategy (Li et al., 
2024b). The initial search was conducted on July 30, 2024, following 
established systematic review protocols (Page et al., 2021; PRISMA, 
2015). This first round served multiple methodological purposes: it 
enabled preliminary screening and analysis of the existing literature, 
facilitated the development of evaluation criteria, and informed the 
refinement of our research questions. Furthermore, this initial phase was 
instrumental in the development of our coding framework, which 
emerged through iterative analysis of the identified literature.
Following the preliminary analysis phase, during which we system-
atically evaluated the collected articles and refined our inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, we conducted a second round of searches on October 
23, 2024. Due to publication lag, database indexing practices, and the 
availability of early-access research, this approach captured articles 
published beyond the search date. To maintain clear temporal bound-
aries, we excluded articles with publication dates extending into 2025. 
This dual-phase search strategy offered several methodological advan-
tages. First, it allowed for the systematic development and validation of 
our analytical framework through iterative refinement. Second, it 
enabled us to capture emerging literature that might have been missed 
in a single-point search. Third, it provided sufficient time for the thor-
ough development and validation of our codebook, which was essential 
for ensuring coding reliability and analytical rigor.
2.1.2. Literature screening
The initial search yielded 1214 articles. The screening of identified 
articles was conducted using Rayyan, a web-based application designed 
for systematic reviews. It only facilitated the screening process, but 
human researchers made all inclusion or exclusion decisions (Table 1) 
based on predefined criteria, without autonomous influence from the 
tool. Key features of Rayyan utilized include (1) tagging and organiza-
tion of articles, (2) independent review capabilities, (3) decision com-
parison tools, and (4) screening record maintenance.
Three researchers independently performed the screening process. 
The PRISMA Flow Diagram effectively illustrates the systematic review 
process followed in this study (Fig. 1). During the screening phase, based 
on abstract reading, 887 records were excluded for reasons such as 
irrelevance to language education, lack of focus on Gen AI, or being 
published before 2023. This left 251 reports for retrieval, of which two 
B. Li et al.

could not be retrieved. Out of the 249 reports assessed for eligibility, 99 
were excluded for reasons such as being theoretical or conceptual pa-
pers, not involving real Gen AI, or having quality issues. The quality 
assessment of study eligibility followed guidelines by Petticrew and 
Roberts (2006), examining criteria such as clarity of research questions, 
appropriateness of study design, and rigor in data analysis. Ultimately, 
144 studies (see details in appendix A) were included in the final review. 
Disagreements during screening were resolved through discussion or 
consultation with a third researcher. The initial inter-rater agreement 
was 82.14 %, indicating an almost perfect level of consensus according 
to Landis and Koch (1977).
3. Manual extraction of data from full-text articles
We have conducted a thorough and systematic extraction of data 
from full-text articles (Table 2).
3.1. Data analysis
The data analysis process was guided by our research questions and 
encompassed four main dimensions. First, research quality indicators 
were analyzed through journal metrics (SSCI/ESCI indexing, Impact 
Factors), methodological approaches (qualitative, quantitative, mixed 
methods), and theoretical frameworks (identified and categorized 
theoretical foundations). Second, geographical patterns were examined 
through both research locations and the affiliations of the authors. 
Third, implementation contexts were coded for educational levels, 
target languages, and technological tools used.
The thematic analysis followed a two-phase approach, aligning with 
our systematic search strategy. After the initial search (July 30, 2024), 
we conducted a preliminary analysis of 101 articles to develop a sys-
tematic coding framework. This empirically derived framework 
(Table 3) identified six key dimensions: ethical considerations, imple-
mentation strategies, cognitive-affective factors, language skills, peda-
gogical practices, and social aspects. Each dimension emerged from 
recurring patterns in the literature rather than predetermined 
categories.
This initial framework then guided our comprehensive analysis of 
the complete dataset (144 articles) following the second search round 
(October 23, 2024). The final thematic categories presented in the Re-
sults section reflect the refined analysis of the complete dataset, showing 
how the research landscape evolved from our preliminary findings.
4. Findings
4.1. RQ1: characteristics and development patterns
4.1.1. Publication volume and journal quality
The sheer volume of empirical studies published in 2024 is 
remarkable. Fig. 2 illustrates an exponential growth trajectory, with the 
total number of publications increasing nearly sixfold in just two years, 
from 21 articles in 2023 to 123 articles in 2024. This trend highlights 
how swiftly the academic community has responded to the emergence of 
Gen AI technologies.
The distribution across journal tiers exhibits particularly noteworthy 
patterns. In 2023, of the 21 total publications, four (19 %) were pub-
lished in SSCI-indexed journals, 10 (47.6 %) in ESCI-indexed journals, 
and seven (33.3 %) in other outlets. This distribution shifted dramati-
cally in 2024, with 68 articles (55.3 %) appearing in SSCI-indexed 
journals, 31 (25.2 %) in ESCI-indexed journals, and 24 (19.5 %) in 
other venues, totaling 123 publications. The significant increase in SSCI- 
indexed articles suggests that more studies on Gen AI in language edu-
cation are achieving higher quality and impact. This indicates that the 
field is maturing and that research is becoming more robust.
The top right corner of Fig. 2 displays a pie chart breaking down the 
2024 articles by index categories: SSCI (53.7 %), ESCI (30.6 %), and NA 
(15.7 %). The journals indexed in SSCI are classified into specific aca-
demic domains based on their primary focus areas (Fig. 3). These do-
mains include: (1) Education Technology and E-Learning (emphasizing 
technological advancements in education, online learning, and e- 
learning systems, n = 31), (2) Applied Linguistics and Language 
Learning (focusing on research in language acquisition, second language 
teaching, and computational linguistics, n = 28), (3) Human-Computer 
Interaction and Learning Environments (combining aspects of HCI and 
educational settings to study interactions between humans and tech-
nology, n = 4), and (4) Interdisciplinary and Social Sciences (addressing 
broader issues in education and other interdisciplinary concerns, n = 7). 
Fig. 4 provides more details.
Among the top 8 journals by publication volume (Fig. 5), Computers 
and Education: Artificial Intelligence emerged as the leading venue with 16 
articles, followed by Education and Information Technologies (SSCI) with 
14 articles. The Arab World English Journal (ESCI) ranked third with 9 
articles, while System (SSCI) and Computer Assisted Language Learning 
(SSCI) published 7 and 5 articles, respectively. Three journals, Interna-
tional Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning (NA), Languages 
(ESCI), and Cogent Education (ESCI), each published 3 articles. This 
distribution pattern reflects several notable characteristics of the field: 
(1) a strong presence in technology-enhanced (language) learning 
journals, (2) successful penetration of established education research 
venues, and (3) active participation in emerging open-access platforms.
4.1.2. Methodological approaches
As depicted in Fig. 6, mixed-method research dominated the meth-
odological landscape (56 studies, 38.9 %), followed by qualitative 
studies (48 studies, 33.3 %) and quantitative research (40 studies, 27.8 
%). Mixed methods studies showed the most dramatic expansion from 
2023 to 2024, growing from 9 to 47 studies, followed by qualitative 
studies (8–40) and quantitative studies (4–36), maintaining a relatively 
stable proportional distribution despite the significant growth.
Regarding data sources, we categorized them into 9 categories, 
shown in Table 4.
The analysis of data sources across the methodological approaches

revealed distinct patterns in research design and data collection strate-
gies (Appendix B). Most of the collected studies employed one (50.7 %, 
n = 67) data collection method, whereas the others used two (28.1 %, n 
= 37), three (18.2 %, n = 24), and four (3.0 %, n = 4) data collection 
methods. Mixed methods studies demonstrated the most comprehensive 
integration of data sources, primarily utilizing interviews (n = 56), ob-
servations (n = 39), and tests/assessments (n = 29), supplemented by 
performance data (n = 21) and AI-generated content (n = 8). This multi- 
layered approach reflects researchers’ efforts to achieve methodological 
triangulation and enhance the validity of their findings.
Qualitative studies predominantly relied on traditional qualitative 
data collection methods, with interviews (n = 48) and tests/assessments 
(n = 33) serving as the primary data sources. These studies also incor-
porated performance data (n = 18) and observations (n = 12), while 
showing openness to technological integration through multimedia data 
(n = 6) and AI-generated content (n = 7). This pattern suggests a 
balanced approach between conventional qualitative methods and 
innovative data collection techniques.
Quantitative research displayed a unique combination of traditional 
and digital approaches, centering on interviews (n = 40) and observa-
tions (n = 27). The integration of performance data (n = 9) and docu-
ment analysis (n = 6), along with the distinctive use of corpus data (n =
4), indicates a methodological evolution in quantitative research design. 
Despite limited multimedia usage (n = 3), these studies demonstrated 
adaptability in incorporating various data sources to strengthen their 
empirical foundations.
Across all methodological approaches, interviews emerged as the 
dominant data collection method, while digital data sources (including 
multimedia, logs, and corpus data) showed consistent but limited inte-
gration. The emergence of AI-generated content as a notable data 
source, particularly in mixed methods and qualitative studies, signals a 
growing recognition of technological tools in research methodology.
A notable trend from 2023 to 2024 across all methodological ap-
proaches was the increased integration of technological and digital data 
sources. AI-generated content gained prominence, particularly in mixed 
methods (1–7) and qualitative studies (2–5). Performance data 
collection also saw substantial growth across all methodologies, with 
mixed methods showing the most significant increase (3–18), followed 
by qualitative (3–15) and quantitative approaches (1–8). This evolution 
suggests a maturing research landscape that increasingly embraces 
technological innovation while maintaining traditional methodological 
rigor.
4.1.3. Theoretical frameworks
Six distinct categories of theoretical frameworks employed were 
identified, as detailed in Table 5. The selection of frameworks, such as 
Technology Acceptance Models and AI Literacy, suggests a strong 
emphasis on understanding and improving the practical use of Gen AI 
tools in educational contexts.
The analysis reveals five prominent theoretical frameworks 
employed across the studies (Fig. 7), with the Technology Acceptance 
Model (TAM) and its extended versions emerging as the dominant 
theoretical framework, referenced in 12 studies. The Technological 
Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) Model follows as the second 
most frequently used framework with 5 references. Three other frame-
works, the L2 Motivational Self System, the Unified Theory of Accep-
tance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and Self-Directed Learning 
Framework, each appear in 3 studies.

4.1.4. Geographic and institutional distribution
The geographical analysis encompassed two main aspects: (1) the 
geographical and cultural diversity of study locations (where the 
research was conducted or the participants are from), shown in Fig. 8, 
and (2) the distribution of first author affiliations displayed in Fig. 9 (A 
full country-level breakdown of study counts is provided in Appendix C).
Research Locations. The geographical distribution of study locations 
reveals significant regional disparities in Gen AI language education 
research. East Asia emerged as the dominant region, with Mainland 
China contributing the largest number of studies (n = 28), followed by 
Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong SAR (n = 11 each). The United States (n =
4) and the United Kingdom (n = 3) represented the major Western 
research sites. Southeast Asian countries demonstrated moderate 
research activity, including Indonesia (n = 6), Thailand (n = 5), the 
Philippines (n = 2), and Vietnam (n = 2).
The Middle Eastern region showed substantial research presence, 
primarily through Saudi Arabia (n = 11) and Iran (n = 9), com-
plemented by smaller contributions from Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, and 
Yemen (n = 1 each). European representation was relatively limited, 
distributed across the UK, Belgium, Germany, Ukraine, and Poland. 
Oceania’s presence was minimal, represented solely by New Zealand (n 
= 1). Notably absent were studies from Africa and South America, 
indicating significant geographical gaps in the current research 
landscape.
Author Distribution. While China has many study locations (n = 28), 
fewer first authors (n = 23) suggest some studies might be collaborative 
efforts with international researchers studying Chinese contexts. 
Conversely, Hong Kong SAR’s higher first authorship (n = 17) compared

to study locations (n = 11) suggests their researchers might be leading 
studies in other regions.
The US had a striking difference between study locations (n = 4) and 
the number of first authors (n = 12), suggesting that US researchers 
might be more involved in studying international contexts. A similar 
pattern was found for Australia/New Zealand, indicating Oceanian re-
searchers are actively studying Asian contexts. This dynamic demon-
strates how regional or international collaborations shape the discourse 
in Gen AI research. The strong presence of Saudi Arabia and Iran in both 
categories suggests substantial investment in Gen AI research. The 
absence of South American and African representation in both cate-
gories highlights a significant gap, which could affect our understanding 
of Gen AI implementation in diverse linguistic and educational contexts.

4.2. RQ2: integration of generative AI in language education
4.2.1. Learning contexts
Educational Levels. As depicted in Fig. 10, the educational level 
distribution in the included articles reveals a striking predominance of 
higher education studies, accounting for 86.7 % (n = 124) of all publi-
cations. This concentration can be attributed to several factors: the 
widespread availability of AI tools in university environments, and the 
technological readiness of both students and faculty. In contrast, ethical 
and privacy concerns are more pronounced with younger learners, and 
centralized decision-making in K-12 education often slows the adoption 
of new technologies. Higher education institutions, by comparison, 
benefit from faculty autonomy, greater financial and technological 
resources, and stronger institutional support for integrating AI. Sec-
ondary education represents 5.6 % (n = 8) of the total, while other 
educational levels show minimal representation: not specified (2.8 %, n 
= 4), mixed levels (2.1 %, n = 3), adult education (1.4 %, n = 2), and 
primary/elementary education (1.4 %, n = 2).
The temporal comparison between 2023 and 2024 shows significant 
growth, particularly in higher education research, with an increase of 90 
studies (from 17 to 107 publications). Secondary education saw a 
modest increase of 6 studies (from 1 to 7), while adult education 
emerged in 2024 with two new studies. Mixed-level studies increased by 
three, and primary/elementary education by two studies.
However, notable research gaps persist, particularly in primary/ 
elementary (only 1.4 %) and secondary education (only 5.6 %), indi-
cating opportunities for investigating age-appropriate applications and 
pedagogical frameworks. The research categorized as “not specified” 
decreased slightly (−2 studies). The decline may indicate improved 
reporting and specificity in studies as the field matures.
Target Languages. The analysis of language studied across the 
included studies reveals a strong dominance of English language studies, 
accounting for 86.1 % (n = 124) of the total research corpus. Within this 
category, English as Foreign Language (EFL) contexts represent the 
majority (n = 120), while other English learning contexts include Aca-
demic English (n = 2), English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI) (n = 1), 
and English for Specific Purposes (ESP) (n = 1).
Chinese language learning emerges as the second most studied lan-
guage, representing 3.5 % (n = 5) of the corpus, all focusing on Chinese 
as a Foreign Language (CFL). However, limited research attention is 
given to other modern languages, including major world languages, 
such as Spanish, suggesting a need for more diverse language repre-
sentation in Gen AI education research. Other languages show minimal 
representation: Thai (0.7 %, n = 1), Ancient Greek (0.7 %, n = 1), and 
Classical Latin (0.7 %, n = 1). Non-specified language contexts account 
for 8.3 % (n = 12) of the corpus.

frequently used/mentioned tool (n = 116; including both actual usage 
and studies discussing perceptions/experiences), followed by Gram-
marly (n = 7), Quillbot (n = 5), Microsoft Copilot (n = 3), Claude (n = 3), 
Erine Bot/Wenyan Yixin (n = 3), Bing Chat (n = 2) and Poe (n = 4). 
Other digital tools, such as Brainly, Cool E Bot, Notion AI, and Twee 
appeared only once in the collected articles. This indicates that from 
2023 to 2024, most empirical studies concentrated on exploring 
Chat GPT for various applications, serving for auto-evaluation, feedback, 
assessment, material authoring, conversation, and translation. Addi-
tionally, 14 out of 144 analyzed articles did not explicitly specify the 
Gen AI tools employed in their language learning or teaching studies, 
only discussing their application in general terms. The findings suggest a 
need for future empirical research to diversify its focus and explore a 
broader range of digital tools.
4.2.3. Research focus areas
Through inductive coding, six broad thematic categories of research 
focus were generated: (1) Perceptions and Attitudes, (2) Psychological 
and Cognitive Aspects, (3) Teaching & Learning Strategies, (4) Language 
Skills Development, (5) Writing & Feedback, and (6) Implementation & 
Integration. These categories are not mutually exclusive but are highly 
interconnected, with many studies addressing two or more themes 
simultaneously. We categorized each study by its primary focus for 
analytical clarity. Fig. 11 provides a breakdown of the number of studies 
in each thematic category. (Note that some studies were double-counted 
in this figure if they equally covered two themes, so totals may slightly 
exceed 144.)
Perceptions and Attitudes. Research on perceptions and attitudes 
has emerged as a dominant theme in the current literature, with studies 
(n = 60) examining multiple stakeholder perspectives on Gen AI inte-
gration in language education. Teacher perceptions have been exten-
sively studied (n = 21, 35.0 %), revealing complex attitudes ranging 
from enthusiasm to apprehension. Moorhouse (2024) found that 
beginning teachers’ readiness for Gen AI integration varied significantly, 
while Kohnke et al. (2023) highlighted the critical role of institutional 
support in shaping teacher attitudes. The cultural context significantly 
influences these perceptions, as demonstrated by studies across different 
geographical regions. For instance, Ulla et al. (2023) examined Thai EFL 
teachers’ perspectives, revealing both pedagogical advantages and 
challenges, while Al-khresheh (2024) investigated Saudi contexts, 
emphasizing the need for structured professional development. Teacher 
educators’ viewpoints have also received attention, with Moorhouse 
et al. (2024) documenting how Gen AI is reshaping initial language 
teacher education.
Student perceptions form another crucial aspect of this theme, with 
research (n = 34, 56.7 %) indicating generally positive attitudes toward 
Gen AI tools, albeit with notable variations. Cultural and contextual 
factors significantly influence student acceptance, as demonstrated by 
Alharthi (2024) in Saudi Arabia and Teng (2024) in Macau. Ma (2024)
further contributed to this understanding by examining how cultural 
and individual determinants (e.g., personal innovativeness, subjective 
norms, facilitating conditions) affect students’ perceptions and utiliza-
tion of Gen AI tools. These studies collectively suggest that acceptance 
patterns are deeply influenced by institutional, cultural, and individual 
factors, highlighting the need for contextualized approaches to Gen AI 
integration in language education.
Additionally, except for three studies (5.0 %) not explicitly speci-
fying their participant types, two studies (3.3 %) examined students’ and 
teachers’ perceptions simultaneously. Alharbi (2024) compared the 
discrepancies of the perceptions of Gen AI tools between teacher and 
student while Bucol and Sangkawong (2024) discussed both perceptions 
through examining Chat GPT’s potential as an automated writing eval-
uation tool in Thailand.
Psychological and Cognitive Aspects. This theme encompasses af-
fective factors and cognitive outcomes associated with Gen AI use. It was 
a major focus in 41 studies. Within this, the most examined constructs 
were motivation and engagement. Sixteen studies (39.0 % of this subset) 
looked at critical thinking and cognitive engagement. For example, 
Liang and Wu (2024) explored using Chat GPT to foster EFL learners’ 
critical thinking from a post-humanist perspective, and Liu, Zhang, and 
Biebricher (2024) investigated cognitive processes in AI-assisted 
multimodal composing versus traditional writing. Another eleven 
studies (26.8 %) examined motivation and enjoyment. Zheng et al. 
(2024) found positive effects of Gen AI use on learner motivation, and 
Liu, Darvin, and Ma (2024) used D¨ornyei’s L2 Motivational Self System 
to understand how Gen AI might influence language learning motiva-
tion, with Huang and Mizumoto (2024) linking motivational self sys-
tems to technology acceptance (showing, for instance, that an “ought-to 
L2 self” can predict actual usage of AI tools). Across these, studies 
consistently found positive associations between Gen AI tool use and 
student motivation or engagement.

In terms of self-efficacy and confidence (7 studies, 17.1 %), research 
has begun to reveal that using Gen AI tools can influence learners’ and 
teachers’ self-efficacy. For instance, Huang et al. (2024) studied gener-
ative AI acceptance and found that exposure to Gen AI (in this case 
Chat GPT) could increase teachers’ self-efficacy in using AI for teaching. 
Wang, Gao, and Wang (2024) performed a latent profile analysis on 
Chinese university students and identified distinct engagement profiles, 
suggesting that students with higher self-efficacy tended to engage more 
and experience lower anxiety when using an LLM for learning. Detailed 
clarifications of our findings are as follows: Huang et al. (2024) reported 
that integrating Chat GPT in class activities boosted both teacher and 
student confidence in AI-assisted tasks, and Wang, Zou, et al. (2024)

found that a subgroup of students with high self-efficacy and low anxiety 
had the most active and beneficial engagement with the AI tool. Simi-
larly, Duong and Nguyen (2024) found that students with higher 
self-efficacy (and proficiency) viewed AI-generated writing as more 
credible and useful than those with lower self-efficacy. These findings 
illustrate that self-efficacy is an important factor in Gen AI adoption and 
can be enhanced through successful AI tool use, which in turn can affect 
learning behaviors.

Anxiety and emotional responses were addressed in five studies 
(12.2 %). For example, Çelik et al. (2024) investigated how simplifying 
reading texts with AI affected reading anxiety, and Shen and Guo (2024)
explored Chinese EFL teachers’ emotions (anxiety, stress, enjoyment, 
satisfaction) in AI-mediated classes. A noteworthy observation is the 
potential of Gen AI to reduce certain anxieties: Zheng (2024) specifically 
noted that using Chat GPT for reading could help lower foreign language 
reading anxiety among high school students. Across these studies, 
findings show that when Gen AI is introduced with proper support, it can 
mitigate some learner anxieties (e.g., fear of writing a draft from 
scratch), but it may simultaneously introduce new concerns (e.g., fear of 
over-reliance on AI). Emotional and psychological factors are clearly 
central to Gen AI integration and will need further study as the tech-
nology becomes more prevalent.
Lastly, two studies (4.9 %) looked at well-being and psychological 
support in AI-supported contexts. Huang et al. (2024) investigated how 
the acceptance of generative AI might affect EFL learners’ well-being, 
and Rezai et al. (2024) examined the correlation between Chat GPT 
use and student well-being with emotion regulation as a mediating 
factor. While this is a small subset, it points to an intriguing direction: 
beyond academic performance, how does interacting with AI impact 
learners’ overall well-being?
Teaching & Learning Strategies. The analysis revealed 22 empirical 
studies focusing on teaching and learning strategies in Gen AI-mediated 
language education. These studies were categorized into five distinct 
subthemes: assessment strategies, self-regulated learning (SRL), self- 
directed learning (SDL), AI literacy education, and prompt engineering.
Assessment strategies emerged as the most extensively studied area, 
comprising 27.3 % (n = 6) of the studies in this theme. Evaluating the 
reliability of LLMs for assessment is a key shared theme, with three main 
strands of comparison: human versus GAI tools, comparisons among 
different GAI tools, and the use of GAI as assessment tools. Kyung-Mi 
(2024) conducted a comparative study examining AI-human-made 
versus human-made test forms for TESOL theory courses, finding com-
parable reliability between the two approaches. Yavuz et al. (2024)
investigated the validity and reliability of LLMs (specifically Chat GPT 
and Bard) in grading student essays based on rubrics, providing 
empirical evidence for the potential of AI in assessment processes. Shin 
and Lee (2024a) explored Chat GPT as an automated writing evaluation 
tool and concluded that while AI feedback can be immediate and 
helpful, human oversight is still needed, especially for nuanced errors 
and in high-stakes contexts (echoing the human-AI balance issue).
Self-regulated learning represented 22.7 % (n = 5) of the studies, 
forming the second largest subtheme. The SRL studies demonstrated 
particular depth in examining cognitive and metacognitive dimensions 
of language learning with Gen AI tools. Liu, Hwaung et al. (2024)
investigated the effects of LLMs integration on EFL writing instruction, 
documenting improvements in self-regulated learning strategies, 
particularly in planning, text generation, revising, and self-monitoring 
processes. Zhang, Liu, et al. (2024) employed Zimmerman and Moy-
lan’s (2009) SRL Model to examine Chinese EFL learners’ online 
self-regulated learning, finding that Gen AI tools facilitated specific SRL 
strategies, such as help-seeking, self-evaluation, and environment 
structuring. Wang (2024) contributed valuable insights into the socio-
cultural dynamics of self-regulated use of machine translation and 
Gen AI tools in academic EFL writing.
Self-directed learning and AI literacy each accounted for 18.2 % (n =
4) of the studies. The SDL research strand revealed interesting patterns 
in informal and out-of-class learning contexts. Li et al. (2023a, 2023b, 
2024a) conducted a series of interconnected studies examining SDL in 
various contexts, including an analysis of You Tube content creation 
related to Chat GPT, which provides insights into how learners inde-
pendently leverage AI tools. Their research culminated in proposing a 
refined framework for SDL that specifically incorporates generative AI 
elements, emphasizing the interplay between learners’ personal attri-
butes and learning processes in technology-enhanced environments (Li 
et al., 2024a).
Concurrently, there is a shared focus on developing frameworks to 
support language teachers’ professional development and competency 
frameworks, though with distinct emphases. Ma et al. (2024) developed 
and validated a comprehensive Chat GPT literacy framework for lan-
guage teachers based on six key constructs: benefits, limitations,

prompts, evaluation, assessment, and ethics. Drawn from the concept of 
professional Digital Competence (PDC), Moorhouse et al. (2024) pro-
posed a new framework to investigate professional Gen AI competence 
development among pre-service language teachers. Through structured 
professional development programs, Urazbayeva et al. (2024) examined 
how Chat GPT could bridge digital competence gaps among EFL teach-
ers. Together, these studies highlight the growing interest in equipping 
pre-service and in-service language teachers with necessary AI knowl-
edge, skills, and advanced frameworks to enhance their professional 
development.
Though representing the smallest proportion of studies (13.6 %, n =
3), the prompt engineering research provided valuable insights into AI- 
human interaction patterns. Woo et al. (2024) examined EFL students’ 
prompt engineering rules for human-AI story writing through an activity 
theory perspective, identifying common qualities of students’ activity 
systems for different themes. Wang and Gayed (2024) compared 
fine-tuning versus zero-shot prompting in automated essay evaluation, 
offering empirical evidence for the effectiveness of different prompting 
strategies in educational contexts.
Language Skills Development. The integration of Gen AI in language 
skills development (n = 39) reveals varying impacts across different 
competencies, with writing skills receiving the most research attention 
(51.3 %, n = 20), followed by studies examining multiple integrated 
skills (17.9 %, n = 7), reading skills (10.3 %, n = 4), speaking skills (7.7 
%, n = 3), grammar development (7.7 %, n = 3), and vocabulary 
enhancement (5.1 %, n = 2).
In oral communication development, Tai and Chen (2024) conducted 
groundbreaking research examining the impact of generative AI chat-
bots on elementary EFL learners’ speaking skills, focusing on both in-
dividual and paired interactions. Their study challenged previous 
assumptions about AI’s limitations with young learners. Pavlenko and 
Syzenko (2024) investigated Ukrainian students’ experiences with 
Chat GPT, including its application in speaking practice. Darmawansah 
et al. (2024) utilized Toulmin’s model for analyzing argumentative 
speaking performance with Chat GPT support.
In reading comprehension, Çelik et al. (2024) investigated the 
effectiveness of AI text simplification on reading comprehension, 
inferencing abilities, and reading anxiety among Turkish EFL learners. 
This work was complemented by Daweli and Mahyoub (2024), who 
explored EFL learners’ perspectives on using AI tools in reading in-
struction. Zheng (2024) specifically examined the effects of an AI-based 
chatbot, “Reading Bot,” on foreign language reading anxiety and 
reading performance among Chinese secondary school students.
In lexical development, Mugableh (2024) compared the impact of 
Chat GPT-generated exercises versus traditional exercises on Saudi EFL 
students’ vocabulary size and word family strength. Lew et al. (2024)
examined Chat GPT’s effectiveness as a lexical tool compared to bilin-
gual and monolingual learners’ dictionaries. In the context of grammar 
learning, Kucuk (2024) investigated the benefits and concerns of 
Chat GPT in grammar learning and teaching for EFL students.
The development of integrated language skills through AI-mediated 
activities has also received attention. Karatas¸ et al. (2024) investigated 
impacts across reading, writing, grammar, and vocabulary through 
qualitative interviews, while Van Horn (2024) examined autonomous 
learning across multiple skills through surveys, interviews, and 
observations.
Writing & Feedback. Writing-related research emerged as the most 
prominent thematic category, with 61 studies (42.4 % of the total 
corpus) examining various dimensions of Gen AI integration in language 
writing instruction and practice. These studies revealed five inter-
connected domains of investigation: AI-assisted writing processes (n =
23), focusing on comparison essays generated from Chat GPT and stu-
dents (Mizumoto et al., 2024); feedback and revision dynamics (n = 28), 
examining different automated evaluation tools (Gozali et al., 2024; 
Yavuz et al., 2024); academic writing development (n = 7), particularly 
in research paper composition (Fathi & Rahimi, 2024); genre-specific 
writing support (n = 2), spanning academic to story writing (Woo 
et al., 2024); and error analysis patterns (n = 4), investigating both 
cognitive and discourse-level improvements (Han & Li, 2024; Koltov-
skaia et al., 2024). Notably, 55.7 % of these studies integrated psycho-
logical factors, examining anxiety, self-efficacy, motivation, enjoyment, 
and self-esteem in AI-supported contexts.
The intersection of Gen AI with writing instruction and feedback 
represents one of the most extensively researched areas in the current 
literature. Han and Li (2024) specifically examined Chat GPT-supported 
teacher feedback in the Chinese tertiary EFL context, while Mahapatra 
(2024) conducted a mixed-methods intervention study investigating 
Chat GPT’s impact on ESL students’ academic writing skills. Both studies 
focused on the integration of AI feedback into established writing 
pedagogies.
In the realm of automated writing evaluation, several studies have 
examined the efficacy of AI-generated feedback. Mizumoto et al. (2024)
conducted a comparative analysis of linguistic fingerprints to identify 
Chat GPT-generated texts in EFL students’ writing. Guo et al. (2024)
investigated the effects of an AI-supported approach to peer feedback on 
university EFL students’ feedback quality and writing ability, specif-
ically examining how AI tools can enhance traditional peer review 
processes. This research was complemented by Koltovskaia et al. (2024), 
who explored graduate students’ behavioral, cognitive, and affective 
engagement with Chat GPT for academic text revision.
The collaborative aspects of AI-assisted writing have emerged as a 
significant focus. Tsai et al. (2024) investigated the feasibility and 
challenges of Chat GPT-assisted writing for EFL English majors, while 
Punar ¨Ozçelik and Yangın Eks¸i (2024) examined Chat GPT’s role as a 
learning assistant in cultivating writing skills. Liu, Zhang, and Biebricher 
(2024) explored the cognitive processes of EFL writers in generative 
AI-assisted digital multimodal composing, comparing them to tradi-
tional writing, providing insights into how students engage with AI tools 
during the writing process.
In terms of writing assessment and evaluation for performance, 
Yavuz et al. (2024) examined the validity and reliability of LLMs in 
grading student essays based on rubrics. Shin and Lee (2024) conducted 
an exploratory study on Chat GPT’s potential as a rater of L2 writing. The 
ethical dimensions of AI-assisted writing were addressed by Foung et al. 
(2024), who investigated different AI platforms for academic writing 
contexts.
In summary, the intersection of Gen AI with writing and feedback is 
richly explored. It represents one of the most promising yet complex 
areas, showing clear benefits (e.g., reduced writing anxiety, improved 
drafts, and individualized feedback) but also raising important consid-
erations (e.g., maintaining academic integrity, ensuring students still 
develop writing skills and not just AI-dependent habits).
Implementation & Integration. This category addresses the practical 
and institutional aspects of utilizing Gen AI in education. It overlaps with 
others but includes studies that, for example, survey how schools or 
universities are adopting AI, or discuss policy, curricula, or 
infrastructure.
Ethical considerations and academic integrity have emerged as 
critical concerns. Almanea (2024) investigated both instructors’ and 
learners’ perspectives on using Chat GPT in EFL courses and its impli-
cations for academic integrity. These findings aligned with institutional 
implementation challenges documented by Moorhouse and Kohnke 
(2024), who examined how teacher educators perceive the effects of 
generative AI tools on initial language teacher education.
The cultural and contextual dimensions of implementation have 
received significant attention. Tafazoli (2024) explored the trans-
formative potential of generative AI in democratizing English language 
education in Iran, highlighting specific challenges faced by teachers in 
resource-constrained environments. Similarly, Ulla et al. (2024) exam-
ined the potential of Gen AI in fostering inclusive language classrooms 
through a critical language pedagogy perspective in the Philippine 
context.

Technical implementation and institutional adoption patterns have 
been documented through several studies. Foung et al. (2024) investi-
gated opportunities for Gen AI-empowered assessment practices, exam-
ining different AI platforms and their integration into academic writing 
assessment. Kohnke et al. (2024) explored generative AI preparedness 
among university language instructors, revealing varying levels of 
institutional support and professional development needs. The transi-
tion toward AI integration has also raised questions about appropriate 
policies and guidelines, as examined by Bannister et al. (2023) in their 
Delphi study on generative artificial intelligence and English Medium 
Instruction assessment.
To summarize RQ2, generative AI has been integrated in various 
ways – as a tutor, a tool, or a subject of study – across numerous contexts. 
The integration is most advanced in writing-related domains and higher 
education settings, whereas other areas (like K-12, non-English lan-
guages, and speaking skills) are still nascent. The thematic foci reveal a 
community grappling with both the opportunities (increased engage-
ment, new strategies, and personalized learning) and the challenges 
(quality of AI output, training needs, and ethical use) of Gen AI in lan-
guage learning.
4.3. RQ3: emerging insights and gaps
Bringing together RQ1 and RQ2 results, several emerging insights 
and gaps become apparent:
The field has seen explosive growth, indicating high interest and a 
rapid accumulation of knowledge. However, this growth is uneven: 
certain areas (writing, higher ed, and English) are thoroughly explored, 
while others (oral skills, K-12, and less commonly taught languages) 
remain largely untouched. This imbalance highlights where future 
research should aim to contribute.
There is evidence that stakeholders are adapting to these changes. 
Teachers and students are developing new literacies (prompting, AI 
literacy) and strategies (blending AI feedback with human guidance). 
The overall sentiment in studies is cautiously optimistic (e.g., Liu, 
Zhang, & Biebricher, 2024; Moorhouse, 2024; Ulla et al., 2024). Most 
participants see Gen AI as helpful if used properly, though they are aware 
of its drawbacks. This suggests a receptive environment for innovation, 
provided proper support and guidelines are in place.
The learner-centered research findings (60 % of the studies) provide 
valuable insights into how students interact with and benefit from Gen 
AI tools. The review shows that current scholarship has found that stu-
dents use Gen AI for ideation and drafting, feedback and revision sup-
port, academic writing development, genre-specific writing assistance, 
and to identify and correct errors at both mechanical and discourse 
levels. The psychological factors of using Gen AI for learning were 
investigated in 47 % of the writing-focused studies suggesting re-
searchers’ growing recognition of the affective dimensions of AI-assisted 
language learning with the following benefits noted in the literature, 
reduced writing anxiety (Zheng, 2024), increased self-efficacy (Huang 
et al., 2024) and enhanced motivation (Du & Alm, 2024). However, as 
most of the studies focused on learners, there has been limited explo-
ration of teacher perspectives and pedagogical strategies, especially in 
K-12, indicating a need for more research on effective instructional 
approaches and professional development.
The research landscape exhibits unexpected patterns of global 
participation, with substantial contributions from regions traditionally 
not associated with early AI adoption. The strong representation from 
East Asia, notably China and Hong Kong SAR, and North America sug-
gests a continuation of the distribution patterns in past AI research in 
language education (e.g., Huang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024b; Zhu & 
Wang, 2024). At the same time, the growing participation of regions less 
represented in earlier research (e.g., Iran, Saudi Arabia, Thailand) 
highlights increasing diversity and global interests in research on 
generative AI in language education. Nevertheless, it is essential to 
acknowledge the persistent lack of studies from the Global South. This 
gap resonates with Zhu and Wang’s (2024) review of research in 
AI-assisted language education over the past decade. Hence, we 
encourage leading journals to issue open calls to promote research 
contributions and voices from these communities, as well as scholarly 
collaborations across regions to address the broader inequalities asso-
ciated with research gaps in AI in language education. This is particu-
larly important given that these communities have been historically 
marginalized in both academic publications and digital development.
Methodological robustness of studies varies. Many early studies were 
exploratory, often with small sample sizes or single-class case studies. 
Only a few employed experimental or longitudinal designs. This means 
that, while the evidence base is rich in breadth, it may not yet strongly 
support causal claims. We observed that very few studies followed 
learners or teachers over a long period to examine the sustained effects 
of AI use. Most are short interventions or one-off surveys. This is un-
derstandable given the recent release of Chat GPT, but it is a gap to be 
filled. There is a need for additional empirical evidence exploring how 
generative AI can be leveraged to enhance the research process for 
language education scholars as a methodological innovation (Pack & 
Maloney, 2023). Future research would benefit from more robust 
methodologies (e.g., control groups, longitudinal tracking, larger, and 
more diverse samples) to build a stronger evidence base.
A notable gap in the literature is academic integrity. While academic 
integrity was a major concern in early discussions when generative AI 
first caught educators’ attention (Yan, 2023; Yeo, 2023), it did not 
predominate in the empirical research studies in year two. This suggests 
that other topics being actively explored (e.g., AI use by teachers and 
learners, AI’s impact on learning) may be of greater interest to re-
searchers at present, possibly because they are easier to investigate 
empirically. However, the lack of empirical studies on academic integ-
rity does not mean the issue is resolved – rather, it indicates a lag in 
research. We suspect more studies on this will emerge as institutions 
grapple with AI-assisted plagiarism and attempt interventions.
Human-AI collaboration emerges as a key insight. Many studies 
implicitly or explicitly deal with how AI and humans can complement 
each other – be it in feedback (AI gives quick comments, teacher gives 
deep critique), in motivation (AI provides practice anytime, teacher 
provides encouragement and personalization), or in content (AI gener-
ates examples, teacher curates and corrects them). The consensus is that 
AI is a tool, not a replacement. How to get the best synergy is still being 
figured out.
In summary, the body of work from 2023 to 2024 paints a picture of a 
field in rapid development. The insights gained so far confirm some 
expectations (e.g., Gen AI can assist writing and reduce some workload) 
and challenge others (e.g., initial fears about AI entirely undermining 
learning have not materialized in the research. Instead, we see more 
nuanced effects).The identified gaps highlight the need for broader and 
deeper research, specifically in reaching different contexts (including 
younger learners, various languages, and under-represented regions) 
and in applying more rigorous, longitudinal methods to gauge impact 
accurately.
5. Discussions
The systematic literature review of the landscape of AI in language 
education research reveals a notable transition from “whether to use AI” 
to “how to use AI effectively”. This marks a significant shift from the 
preliminary exploratory studies that dominated the early part of 2023 to 
more empirical, implementation-focused research in 2024. The evolu-
tion resonates with our analysis and conceptual arguments, as scholars 
who posited that the question is no longer whether educators should 
engage with AI, but how to do so in pedagogically sound ways, given 
that AI tools are here to stay (e.g., Pecorari, 2023; Tseng & Warschauer, 
2023). For instance, while academic integrity was a prominent worry in 
early discussions (Yan, 2023; Yeo, 2023), it did not dominate empirical 
studies in the second year. Researchers instead focused on topics such as 
B. Li et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Computers and Education: Artiϧcial Intelligence 9 (2025) 100445 

--- Page 16 ---

how AI can support writing or how learners feel about integrating AI 
into language learning. This suggests that other topics (e.g., AI’s role in 
instruction, its effects on learners) quickly took precedence, possibly 
because educators began to accept that generative AI would be part of 
education and thus shifted to examining practical implications. None-
theless, the relative lack of empirical work on academic integrity in year 
two highlights a need for more studies in that area, as maintaining 
honesty and originality is an ongoing challenge as students gain access 
to AI assistance. The concept of what constitutes plagiarism or original 
work is being tested. Some institutions have responded by updating 
honor codes to include AI usage (Lau & Guo, 2023), or by asking stu-
dents to document how they used AI (a form of transparency that could 
mitigate misconduct) (Luo, 2024). Future empirical research should 
investigate strategies to uphold academic integrity when students use AI 
(such as honor codes, AI-detection tools, or alternative assessment 
designs).
Another important trend observed is a shift toward addressing the 
emotional and psychological dimensions of AI integration. By 2024, 
research increasingly focused on learners’ and teachers’ emotional re-
sponses (e.g., anxiety, confidence) and on preparing teachers to handle 
AI’s pedagogical implications, rather than just technical evaluations of 
AI tools. This underscores a growing recognition that successful inte-
gration of AI is as much a human issue as a technical one. For example, 
several studies have emphasized teacher preparation and professional 
development (e.g., Moorhouse, 2024; Urazbayeva et al., 2024), indi-
cating that as the technology matures, so is awareness that teachers need 
support and training to adapt to AI. The importance of teacher attitudes 
and skills became evident; if teachers are not comfortable with AI or lack 
institutional support, integration will falter regardless of the technol-
ogy’s capabilities.
The geographical distribution of research shows both diversity and 
imbalance. East Asia and the Middle East emerged as strong contribu-
tors, which aligns with those regions’ proactive stances on educational 
technology (Zawacki-Richter & Qayyum, 2019). However, the near 
absence of work from Africa or Latin America, combined with the 
dominance of English-related contexts, implies a geopolitical and lin-
guistic skew. This imbalance could inadvertently perpetuate educational 
inequalities: If most insights and tools are developed in well-resourced 
English-dominant or EFL contexts, they might not address the needs of 
learners in less-represented regions or other languages. Moreover, AI 
models themselves, which are predominantly trained on English and 
other major languages, may not perform as well for underrepresented 
languages, potentially widening the gap. This cultural-linguistic hege-
mony is an ethical concern; global deployment of AI tools in language 
learning should consider local linguistic contexts to avoid a 
one-size-fits-all approach that favors English. As a recommendation, the 
field should strive for a more inclusive research agenda by encouraging 
and funding studies in diverse contexts. International collaborations can 
be pivotal here – for example, partnerships where researchers from 
AI-rich regions team up with those in under-studied regions to pilot 
Gen AI interventions. Such efforts would ensure that the benefits of 
Gen AI are accessible globally and help in developing AI tools that are 
culturally and linguistically adaptable (Zhu & Wang, 2024).
The balance between human and AI feedback emerges as a key 
conceptual tension. Our review indicates that while AI can provide 
immediate, detailed feedback (especially for writing), there is consensus 
that human teachers’ role remains irreplaceable in providing nuanced 
guidance, moral support, and addressing higher-order concerns. Some 
studies (e.g., Han & Li, 2024) show promising models of teachers and AI 
both contributing to the feedback process. An important insight is that 
teachers might shift to more strategic roles. For instance, letting AI 
handle routine corrective feedback while they focus on creative aspects, 
critical thinking, or personalizing feedback based on individual student 
needs. Achieving the right balance will require clear guidelines on when 
and how to use AI in the feedback loop. This also ties into teacher 
training: teachers need to learn how to interpret AI feedback and how to 
advise students in using it productively. From a policy standpoint, 
educational institutions might develop frameworks such as allowing 
AI-generated feedback on drafts but requiring a human teacher to 
oversee final assessments, ensuring that automated feedback has been 
adequately understood and applied by the student.
Our review period being early, many empirical studies did not ven-
ture into measuring the issues mentioned above, but moving forward, 
we expect experimental studies on strategies to deter misuse (for 
example, comparing classes that ban AI vs. those that openly use it in a 
guided way, in terms of learning outcomes and instances of cheating). In 
the meantime, our discussion acknowledges this concern and suggests 
that open dialogue with students about ethical AI use, combined with 
assessments that value process over product (thus discouraging last- 
minute AI-written answers), may be practical steps.
6. Implementation for theory and practice
The trends observed carry several implications. The dominance of 
higher education contexts suggests that theories of adult learning and 
self-directed learning are particularly relevant. For instance, the use of 
Gen AI might be interpreted through the lens of constructivist theory 
(learners constructing knowledge with AI as a scaffold) or through Self- 
Determination Theory (as some studies did, looking at how AI use affects 
intrinsic motivation). The positive impacts on motivation and reductions 
in anxiety align with theories that stress student empowerment and 
affect in learning. This could encourage a theoretical framing of Gen AI 
integration as something that can increase learners’ self-efficacy (Ban-
dura’s theory) by providing immediate success experiences (like pro-
ducing a good piece of writing with AI help, which then makes the 
learner feel more capable).
Pedagogically, the results underscore that teachers may need to 
adopt new roles (becoming facilitators of AI-augmented learning) and 
develop new pedagogies. For example, task-based learning might evolve 
to incorporate AI. A task could be “use Chat GPT to plan a trip and then 
critique its plan.” The finding that students often rely on AI for idea 
generation suggests that pedagogies should incorporate guidance on 
critical thinking, teaching students not just to accept AI outputs but to 
question and improve them.
From a policy perspective, educational institutions should begin 
developing policies for AI usage. The research community’s shift toward 
practical integration issues indicates that now is the time to establish 
norms, such as policies on citation when AI is used, guidelines for 
teachers on allowing AI in assignments, or providing resources/training 
for AI literacy. There is also an implication for resource allocation: in-
stitutions might invest in AI tools or subscriptions for students (to pre-
vent inequity where only some students have access), and in IT 
infrastructure (ensuring the tools run smoothly on school networks).
7. Limitations
This systematic review has several methodological limitations that 
should be considered when interpreting its findings. First, despite our 
comprehensive search strategy, the rapid pace of publication in this field 
means that some relevant studies may have been missed, particularly 
those published after October 2024 cutoff date or those in press. Post- 
October 2024 scholarship has particularly emphasized the influence of 
Gen AI-assisted language learning, specifically in writing (Goulart et al., 
2024; Nguyen et al., 2024), speaking (Zou et al., 2024), reading (Zhang, 
Lai, et al., 2024), and communicative competence (Wang, Gao, & Wang, 
2024). Moreover, emerging studies have also underscored Chat GPT’s 
innovations in self-directed English learning (Tram et al., 2024), lesson 
planning (Dornburg & Davin, 2024), various stakeholders’ perceptions 
across disciplines (Dolenc & Brumen, 2024), and the interplay between 
L2 motivation and Chat GPT acceptance (Huang & Mizumoto, 2024a).
Additionally, our focus on peer-reviewed journal articles excluded 
potentially valuable insights from conference proceedings, preprints, 
B. Li et al.

and other gray literature. Second, the inclusion criteria which limited 
studies to English-language publications, may have resulted in selection 
bias, potentially missing relevant research published in other languages, 
particularly given the global nature of language education research. This 
limitation is especially pertinent for studies from regions where English 
is not the primary language of academic publication (e.g., Chinese, 
Spanish, French). Third, while our coding framework emerged through 
iterative analysis, the categorization of studies into thematic areas 
involved subjective judgment, despite efforts to ensure reliability 
through multiple coders. The interconnected nature of many themes 
made discrete categorization challenging, potentially oversimplifying 
complex relationships between different aspects of Gen AI implementa-
tion in language education. Fourth, in our search terms, we specifically 
included the term “GPT”, which may have introduced a search prefer-
ence and potentially excluded studies involving other large language 
models, such as Claude, BERT, or Gemini. Fifth, our reliance on journal 
metrics (SSCI/ESCI indexing, Impact Factors) as quality indicators may 
not fully capture the merit of individual studies, particularly those 
published in newer or specialized journals focused on emerging tech-
nologies in education.
Importantly, we recognize that many studies in this emerging field 
had small sample sizes or short durations, and few were longitudinal. As 
such, while we synthesized their findings, these should be interpreted 
with caution. The evidence base is still developing, and more robust 
research is needed to confirm many of the patterns we discussed. 
Eighthly (and relatedly), our categorization into themes involved some 
subjectivity, although we tried to ensure reliability through double- 
coding. The interconnected nature of themes (e.g., a single study 
might address both psychological aspects and pedagogical strategies) 
means some nuances might be lost in broad categories. Finally, in terms 
of our review’s temporal limitation, it captures a snapshot of a very 
dynamic situation – the landscape even in early 2025 may be shifting 
(indeed, new models such as GPT-4 were introduced during 2024 which 
could change research directions). Therefore, our conclusions should be 
seen as provisional, highlighting immediate past and present trends with 
the understanding that the field is rapidly progressing.
8. Conclusion
In conclusion, two years of intensive exploration into generative AI 
for language learning have yielded valuable insights and pointed to clear 
pathways forward. The field has moved quickly from initial curiosity to 
practical implementation questions, reflecting a maturation in both 
research and practice. Teachers and learners are generally embracing 
the technology, finding that it can enhance engagement, personalize 
learning, and augment teaching. However, they are also encountering 
challenges that require careful thought, such as maintaining academic 
integrity and ensuring equitable access. The scholarly discourse has 
begun to shift from purely descriptive studies to a more critical analysis 
of how AI can be integrated into educational ecosystems in a sustainable 
and ethical manner. For the promise of Gen AI to be fully realized in 
language education, future research should strive to be more inclusive 
(across languages and contexts) and more rigorous, and it should 
continue to interrogate the pedagogical assumptions we hold.
Ultimately, generative AI tools like Chat GPT present an opportunity 
to re-examine fundamental questions of language education: What is the 
role of the teacher when knowledge and feedback are ubiquitous? How 
can assessment evolve when creation can be machine-assisted? How do 
we define language proficiency and development in the presence of AI 
collaborators? The studies from 2023 to 2024 have begun to address 
these questions, but much work remains. By addressing identified gaps – 
expanding context, ensuring ethical practices, and strengthening 
research design – the academic community can build a robust under-
standing of Gen AI’s impact. This will inform educators, policymakers, 
and technologists alike, guiding the integration of AI in ways that 
genuinely enhance language learning while preserving the core values of 
education. The rapid developments thus far make us optimistic: the field 
of CALL (Computer-Assisted Language Learning) has always adapted to 
new technologies, and with generative AI, it stands at its most trans-
formative crossroads yet. This review provides a foundation upon which 
future explorations can build, ensuring that as we move forward, it is 
with both excitement and wisdom.
