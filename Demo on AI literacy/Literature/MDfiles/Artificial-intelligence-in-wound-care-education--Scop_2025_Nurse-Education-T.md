Background: Artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare education, offering innovative teaching and skill 
development approaches. However, its implementation and effectiveness in wound care education remain 
unclear.
Objective: To map and analyze the available evidence on the potential impact of artificial intelligence in wound 
care education, identify knowledge gaps, and provide recommendations for future research.
Design/methods: This scoping review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines for scoping reviews and the 
PRISMA-Sc R guidelines. The search was first conducted in December 2023 and updated on 30 November 2024 
across the following databases: CINAHL Ultimate, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Academic Search Complete, 
Scientific Electronic Library Online (Scielo), Scopus, and Web of Science. Grey literature was accessed through 
Scientific Open Access Scientific Repositories of Portugal (RCAAP), Pro Quest Dissertations and Theses, Open-
AIRE, and Open Dissertations. Additional searches were performed in Google Scholar and specific journals, 
including the International Wound Journal, Skin Research and Technology, Journal of Wound Care, and Wound 
Repair and Regeneration. Eligibility criteria encompassed any study design exploring the use of artificial intel-
ligence in wound care education, published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish, with no restrictions on publi-
cation date.
Results: This review revealed diverse artificial intelligence applications in wound care education, including 
adaptive e-learning platforms, virtual and augmented reality simulations, generative artificial intelligence for 
educational content, and diagnostic and treatment tools. These technologies offer personalized learning expe-
riences, real-time feedback, and interactive engagement to enhance clinical skills. Despite their promise, most 
studies lacked empirical validation, highlighting significant gaps in integrating artificial intelligence into wound 
care education.
Conclusions: This review highlights artificial intelligence’s transformative potential to revolutionize wound care 
education by fostering interactive and evidence-based learning environments. This work highlights the need for 
collaboration among educators, policymakers, and researchers. Future research is needed to ensure effective, 
ethical, and equitable integration of artificial intelligence in wound care education.
1. Introduction
Wound care is a critical area of healthcare, dedicated to effectively 
managing and treating wounds to promote timely healing and reduce 
complications such as infections and amputations. Wounds and their 
treatment represent a significant financial burden on healthcare 
worldwide. In 2022, the estimated cost of wound care reached $148.65 
billion in the United States, making it the highest global spender, 
followed by China ($42.78 billion) and Japan ($22.91 billion). European 
countries like Germany ($23.33 billion) and the United Kingdom 
($13.31 billion) also report substantial financial costs in wound man-
agement (Queen and Harding, 2024). The costs associated with wound 
management are multifaceted, encompassing direct expenses such as 
advanced wound dressings, diagnostic tools, wound assessment tech-
nologies, and professional care services. Additionally, indirect costs 
affect the health care system, patients, and society, including reduced

life expectancy and diminished quality of life, prolonged hospital stays, 
and adverse effects on physical, psychological, and social well-being 
(Black, 2025). Recognizing these financial implications is essential for 
policymakers, healthcare providers, and educators to optimize resource 
allocation, develop preventive strategies, and integrate cost-effective 
innovations into wound care education and practices.
Wound assessment and management are a significant challenge for 
healthcare professionals, requiring accurate diagnosis, precise treat-
ment, consideration of healing factors, patient education, and a focus on 
underlying causes and treatment principles (Ahtiala and Kielo-Viljamaa, 
2024). Treating wounds requires the appropriate knowledge and skills 
to maximize patient outcomes (Powers et al., 2016; Welsh, 2018). Ed-
ucation in wound care is essential for students and healthcare pro-
fessionals, as it enhances their ability to understand the principles of 
wound care, perform accurate assessments, identify risk factors, and 
develop critical thinking for clinical decision-making (Ahtiala and Kielo- 
Viljamaa, 2024). This facilitates the implementation of evidence-based 
interventions and innovative practices into patient care, ultimately 
improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.
Wound care education has traditionally followed established 
methods, primarily focusing on theoretical knowledge and fundamental 
techniques. However, there has been a growing recognition of the 
importance of hands-on experience and active learning, highlighting the 
need for a more integrated and dynamic approach to enhance care 
effectiveness. In recent years, innovative technologies such as simula-
tion, peer mentoring, and online and blended learning have transformed 
wound care education, providing more effective and efficient opportu-
nities to improve training and care practices (Ahtiala and Kielo- 
Viljamaa, 2024). Previous studies have demonstrated that simulation 
improves students’ knowledge, skills, clinical reasoning, performance, 
satisfaction, and self-confidence (Luo, 2024; Mac Lean et al., 2024; Silva 
et al., 2020). Moreover, comprehensive training, incorporating 
debriefing sessions, theoretical education, and practice with standard-
ized patient simulations, has led to more sustained knowledge and better 
clinical performance (Ahtiala and Kielo-Viljamaa, 2024).
Given the evolving nature of wound care, it is essential to continually 
innovate and refine teaching strategies to ensure that learners acquire a 
solid theoretical foundation and develop the practical skills necessary to 
deliver high-quality care. By tailoring educational methods to the needs 
of undergraduate and postgraduate learners, educators can provide a 
more effective and realistic learning experience, which helps students 
apply theory to practice. Healthcare education is evolving significantly 
in response to advancements in medical technology, particularly the 
integration of artificial intelligence, highlighting the need for new 
research on teaching methods (Ahtiala and Kielo-Viljamaa, 2024).
The exact definition of artificial intelligence remains a subject of 
ongoing discussion. Proposed by John Mc Carthy in 1955, the term 
generally refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks and solve 
problems that usually require human intelligence, such as image 
recognition, decision-making, and natural language processing (Helm 
et al., 2020; Jakhar and Kaur, 2020; Wang, 2019). It can be broadly 
defined as incorporating human intelligence and behavior into ma-
chines. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence and 
frequently involves training models to identify patterns and generate 
predictions using a specified dataset. Deep learning, a more advanced 
subset of machine learning, involves training neural networks with 
multiple layers to perform complex tasks like image classification, 
speech recognition, and numerical modeling through weight adjust-
ments (Jakhar and Kaur, 2020; Sheikh et al., 2023). Generative artificial 
intelligence uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to 
create new content—such as images, text, or audio—by learning pat-
terns from existing data and generating outputs that mimic the original 
set. Generative artificial intelligence has many applications; generative 
adversarial networks are commonly utilized for image creation, and 
recurrent neural networks are applied in natural language processing to 
generate text (Preiksaitis and Rose, 2023; Sheikh et al., 2023; Yu and 
Guo, 2023).
Artificial intelligence has become a transformative technology across 
various sectors, including finance, entertainment, healthcare, and edu-
cation. Its applications enable the efficient execution of complex tasks, 
such as data analysis, information integration, event prediction, and 
decision-making support (Ganesan et al., 2024; Martinez-Ortigosa et al., 
2023). Previous studies stated that generative artificial intelligence 
transformed medical education by introducing innovative approaches to 
personalized learning, case-based learning, simulation-based training, 
continuous professional development, and support for research activ-
ities (Preiksaitis and Rose, 2023).
While specific studies directly addressing the role of artificial intel-
ligence in wound care education are limited, this emerging technology 
holds considerable potential in the healthcare sector, with applications 
in robotic surgery, predictive analytics, medical imaging, patient 
monitoring, early diagnosis, workflow improvement, information 
sharing, personalized medicine, decision-making support, virtual pa-
tients, and health chatbots (Alhejaily, 2024; Ali et al., 2023; Dave and 
Patel, 2023; Rony et al., 2024).
Early applications of artificial intelligence in wound care, particu-
larly machine learning and computer vision, have shown potential 
benefits in enhancing wound assessment and management (Chen, 2024; 
Rippon et al., 2024; Sarp et al., 2021). Artificial intelligence systems can 
analyze wound images, improve diagnostic accuracy, and significantly 
contribute to early detection, risk stratification, intelligent treatment, 
outcome prediction, and prognosis evaluation (Chen, 2024; Griffa et al., 
2024; Rippon et al., 2024).
In healthcare education, artificial intelligence has emerged as a 
transformative approach, enhancing the training and education of pro-
fessionals through innovative applications that include intelligent 
tutoring systems, chatbots, robots, performance analytics, virtual pa-
tient simulators, personalized learning platforms, chatbots, augmented 
reality with artificial intelligence, procedure guidance for trainees and 
automated assessment tools (Dave and Patel, 2023; Gordon et al., 2024; 
Mah, 2023). These advancements provide tailored, efficient, immersive, 
and realistic learning experiences through adaptative learning, equip-
ping students and teachers with machine-supported tools for immediate 
guidance on learning progress and areas for improvement (Chiu et al., 
2023; De Gagne, 2023; Hamilton, 2024; Zarei et al., 2024). This 
approach may be extended to wound care education, highlighting the 
importance of exploring its potential applications.
A search across CINAHL Ultimate, MEDLINE (Pub Med), Cochrane 
Database of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO, and Open Science 
Framework databases revealed that, at present, there are no published 
or ongoing scoping reviews or systematic reviews concerning the use of 
artificial intelligence in wound care education. The literature highlights 
many artificial intelligence applications for wound care; however, its 
integration into wound care education remains uncertain. To address 
this, the authors conducted a scoping review to map and analyze the 
available evidence on the potential impact of artificial intelligence in 
wound care education, identify knowledge gaps, and provide recom-
mendations for future research.
2. Methods
A scoping review approach was determined to be the most appro-
priate method, given the limited knowledge about artificial intelligence 
applications in wound care education, the emerging nature of this topic, 
and the purpose of mapping the evidence (Mc Gowan et al., 2016; Peters 
et al., 2020).
The scoping review follows the Joanna Briggs Institute’s methodol-
ogy for scoping reviews (Peters et al., 2020; Tricco et al., 2018) and the 
Guidance for Conducting Systematic Scoping Reviews (Peters et al., 
2020). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- 
Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-Sc R) guidelines were 
used in reporting the study results (Mc Gowan et al., 2016; Tricco et al., 
R. Encarnaç˜ao et al.

2018). A protocol review was registered on the Open Science Frame-
work platform and published as a scientific paper (Encarnaç˜ao et al., 
2024). Minor changes were made to the data extraction table, specif-
ically in the terminology used and its structure, to facilitate the data 
extraction process.
A stepwise process was employed to ensure the inclusion of all 
relevant literature, regardless of study design. This involved formulating 
a research question, conducting a comprehensive search for relevant 
studies, screening eligible studies, charting, synthesizing extracted data, 
and presenting the results.
2.1. Research questions
Scoping review questions should be broad, defining the concept, 
target population, and health outcomes to ensure clarity and a robust 
search strategy (Levac et al., 2010). Research questions for this review 
were developed collaboratively with the research team and stake-
holders, including advanced practice nurses, nurse researchers, and 
educators in digital health technologies and health education.
To address the study’s aims, the research question was formulated 
using the PCC (Population, Concept, Context) mnemonic: What evi-
dence currently exists on the application of artificial intelligence in 
wound care education?
2.2. Search strategy
A search was conducted in the following databases: CINAHL Ulti-
mate (via EBSCOhost), MEDLINE (via Pub Med), Cochrane Library, Ac-
ademic Search Complete, Scientific Electronic Library Online (Scielo), 
Scopus, and Web of Science. Electronic searches were also conducted in 
the Scientific Open Access Scientific Repositories of Portugal (RCAAP) 
and Pro Quest Dissertations and Theses, Open AIRE, and Open Disserta-
tions databases to access grey literature. Additionally, searches were 
performed on Google Scholar and specific journals such as the Interna-
tional Wound Journal, Skin Research and Technology, Journal of 
Wound Care, and Wound Repair and Regeneration.
The search strategy, including all identified keywords and index 
terms, was customized for each literature source (see Supplementary 
material Table S1).
The search was initially conducted in December 2023 and was rerun 
on 30 November 2024 to capture the most recent and relevant studies 
before finalizing this scoping review. All results were imported into the 
Rayyan web application (rayyan.ai) (Ouzzani et al., 2016), and dupli-
cated studies were removed.
2.3. Eligibility criteria
The PCC framework was used to establish the eligibility criteria: 
• Population: this study will encompass all literature that discusses 
participants as healthcare practitioners, students, and educators.
• Concept: this review will include literature that analyses artificial 
intelligence and its influence on wound care education.
• Context: education. To expand the scope of the review, the context 
will be broad and involve any educational settings without 
geographic restrictions.
Articles were included if they addressed artificial intelligence ap-
plications in wound care education. Given the emerging nature of this 
topic, all study designs and grey literature, such as conference abstracts, 
theses, government reports, clinical practice guidelines, and editorial or 
opinion papers, were included. Exclusion criteria comprised studies that 
(1) did not focus on wound care education, (2) were unrelated to arti-
ficial intelligence, or (3) were not published in English, Portuguese, or 
Spanish. No restrictions were applied regarding the year of publication 
to avoid inadvertently excluding relevant studies.
2.4. Evidence screening and study selection
The screening process was first pilot-tested. Following this, the initial 
phase involved independent screening of all titles and abstracts by two 
reviewers for eligibility criteria using the Rayyan web application 
(Ouzzani et al., 2016). In the second phase, potentially relevant records 
were fully obtained through institutional access or by emailing the au-
thors. The full text of potentially relevant evidence was screened ac-
cording to the inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers. 
Searching of reference lists of key papers was also undertaken. In cases 
of uncertainty, decisions were made by consensus after discussions be-
tween reviewers, with any disagreements resolved through consultation 
with a third reviewer until complete agreement was reached.
The methodological quality of the included studies was not assessed, 
as this is generally not recommended in scoping reviews because the aim 
is to map the available evidence rather than provide a synthesized and 
clinically meaningful answer (Peters et al., 2020, 2024).
2.5. Data charting
The data extraction tool was created and pilot-tested by the review 
team based on the Joanna Briggs Institute instrument for extracting 
study details, characteristics, and results (Peters et al., 2020, 2024). Two 
reviewers also completed data extraction for each article, and the third 
reviewer confirmed and achieved the results as needed. Additionally, 
unclear data were clarified by contacting the respective authors. 
Extracted data consisted of study characteristics (title of publication, 
authors, year of publication, country of origin, type of publication, study 
design, study aim, end users of artificial intelligence), wound specifics, 
education details, artificial intelligence details, key findings, educa-
tional implications, and study limitations.
2.6. Data analysis
The same reviewers involved in the previous step conducted this 
procedure independently, with a third reviewer consulted to resolve any 
differences and reach a consensus. Data were analyzed using descriptive 
statistics, while qualitative data were synthesized using content anal-
ysis. The included publications were categorized based on the modality 
in which artificial intelligence was used to support wound care educa-
tion. As the data were heterogeneous, a meta-analysis was not 
performed.
3. Results
3.1. Literature search and selection process
Identified studies from databases and registers included 7420 pub-
lications after de-duplication and language restrictions. Of these, 7332 
publications were excluded after abstract and title screening, and 72 
publications were assessed for full-text examination. Identified studies 
from grey literature and citation searching included 1664 publications. 
Twenty-nine of these were submitted for full-text examination. Fifty-six 
publications identified from databases and registers and 28 from the 
grey literature and citation searching were excluded as they did not meet 
the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). Finally, 17 publications were included in 
this review.
3.2. Study characteristics
The characteristics of the included publications are summarized in 
Table 1, with full results presented in the corresponding data extraction 
table (see Supplementary material Table S2). All reports were published 
between 2006 and 2024, seven of which were in the last three years, 
which suggests a growing interest in this field. The type of publications 
included eight conference papers (47.1 %), eight journal articles (47.1

%), and one editorial paper (5.9 %). Regarding study design, 9 were 
developmental studies (53 %), five experimental studies (29.4 %), and 
three original articles in other categories (17.7 %). Most studies were 
conducted in Europe (70.6 %, n = 12), followed by Asia (11.8 %, n = 2), 
North America (11.8 %, n = 2), and Oceania (5.9 %, n = 1). The included 
studies address various types of wounds, with some focusing specifically 
on certain types, such as pressure ulcers, leg ulcers, and diabetic foot 
ulcers.
All studies explored the use of artificial intelligence to enhance 
wound care education. Key objectives included developing artificial 
intelligence-driven e-learning platforms for wound image analysis and 
adaptive learning (Morente et al., 2011; Morente and Veredas, 2013; 
Prodan et al., 2010a; Veredas et al., 2014) and exploring tools like vir-
tual and augmented reality incorporated with artificial intelligence 
simulations (Ousey et al., 2018), computer vision for suturing assess-
ment (Kil et al., 2024; Noraset et al., 2024), and smartphone applica-
tions for wound detection (Lau et al., 2022). Generative artificial 
intelligence tools were also investigated for creating educational re-
sources (Goktas et al., 2024; Koljonen, 2023), while case-based 
reasoning systems were developed to support evidence-based learning 
in diabetic foot ulcer care (Bender et al., 2022). Broader explorations of 
artificial intelligence benefits and limitations in wound care education 
were also conducted (Heerschap, 2023). Overall, the main goals of the 
studies were to develop, validate, and explore the potential of artificial 
intelligence technologies to improve teaching, learning, and clinical skill 
development in wound care education.
3.3. Educational program details
The educational domains covered by the included studies primarily 
focused on artificial intelligence usage in assessment, learning, and 
teaching. Most studies addressed all three domains simultaneously, 
highlighting the application of artificial intelligence in these areas. 
However, some studies concentrated on specific domains, such as 
assessment (Kil et al., 2024; Noraset et al., 2024), or provided a 
comprehensive analysis of artificial intelligence applications in teach-
ing, learning, and assessment (Heerschap, 2023). Administrative do-
mains were not explicitly addressed in any of the included studies.
The potential recipients of wound care education included nursing, 
medical, and pharmacy students at undergraduate and graduate levels, 
practicing nurses, clinicians, surgical residents, and other healthcare 
professionals in clinical settings. Two studies focused exclusively on 
undergraduate nursing students (Morente and Veredas, 2013; Veredas 
et al., 2014), while two others targeted postgraduate healthcare pro-
fessionals (Bender et al., 2022; Kil et al., 2024). Thirteen studies 
addressed different educational levels, demonstrating artificial in-
telligence’s adaptability to diverse learning needs.
The included studies are in multiple educational contexts, illus-
trating the multidisciplinary nature of wound care education. Nursing 
education was the predominant context, with artificial intelligence- 
driven simulation tools and platforms designed to enhance wound 
diagnosis and treatment competencies in undergraduate and post-
graduate nursing programs (Bender et al., 2022; Morente and Veredas, 
2013; Veredas et al., 2014). Surgical education focuses on tools to train 
healthcare professionals in complex procedural skills such as suturing 
(Kil et al., 2024; Noraset et al., 2024; Seth et al., 2024). These tools 
combined traditional methods with artificial intelligence-driven simu-
lations to improve precision and decision-making in clinical settings.
Beyond nursing and surgery, some studies explored broader health-
care education applications, fostering interdisciplinary learning among 
healthcare professionals (Bender et al., 2022; Heerschap, 2023; Noraset 
et al., 2024).

The curricular structure and duration of the educational programs 
varied significantly across the included studies, with the majority (n =
10, 58.8 %) not providing specific details. This lack of explicit reporting 
may be attributed to the studies’ experimental or developmental lab- 
based nature. Among the studies that described curricular frame-
works, blended learning emerged as the predominant approach, inte-
grating traditional face-to-face teaching methodologies with artificial 
intelligence-supported e-learning scenarios centered on real-world 
medical cases and active learning strategies (Morente and Veredas, 
2013; Prodan et al., 2010a; Veredas et al., 2014).
Duration was explicitly mentioned in only one study, which imple-
mented a 10-week intervention as part of an undergraduate nursing 
program focused on pressure ulcer diagnosis and treatment (Veredas 
et al., 2014). The curriculum included theoretical and practical com-
ponents, with the experimental group using an autonomous e-learning 
platform while the control group followed traditional classroom-based 
methods.
Several studies emphasized the adaptability of educational tools,

suggesting their potential for flexible integration into existing curricula 
(Bender et al., 2022; Heerschap, 2023; Morente and Veredas, 2013; 
Prodan et al., 2010a). The tools in three studies were designed to support 
continuous, active, autonomous, and adaptive learning, tailoring con-
tent to the individual needs of learners (Morente et al., 2011; Morente 
and Veredas, 2013; Veredas et al., 2014).
The included studies reported a wide range of potential outcomes for 
students regarding the application of artificial intelligence in wound 
care education. A key focus was enhancing practical and analytical skills 
in wound assessment and management, often achieved through inter-
active tools and simulations (Prodan et al., 2009, 2010a, 2010b). Arti-
ficial intelligence-based technologies were also associated with 
personalized and adaptive learning, offering tailored educational expe-
riences that align with individual student needs, improve decision- 
making, and enable skill acquisition in online and offline settings 
(Heerschap, 2023; Morente and Veredas, 2013; Veredas et al., 2014).
The use of immersive and interactive simulations, including virtual 
and augmented reality incorporated with machine learning, was re-
ported to enhance engagement and provide realistic practice environ-
ments potentially (Ousey et al., 2018; Prodan et al., 2008b, 2009). 
Similarly, real-time feedback was highlighted as a critical feature of 
artificial intelligence-based tools, offering automated and objective as-
sessments that could improve specific clinical skills, such as suturing 
precision (Kil et al., 2024; Noraset et al., 2024) and wound assessment 
(Heerschap, 2023).
Student engagement and motivation were identified as key benefits 
of artificial intelligence integration, with studies indicating potential 
increased satisfaction and interest in learning due to adaptive and 
interactive features (Lau et al., 2022; Prodan et al., 2008b; Veredas et al., 
2014). Furthermore, artificial intelligence technologies demonstrated 
the potential to support diverse learning needs, providing multilingual 
accessibility, simplified explanations tailored to performance levels, and 
summarized best practice recommendations (Heerschap, 2023).
Other potential outcomes for students included an improved un-
derstanding of pathophysiological processes and treatment rationales 
and enhanced clinical decision-making skills (Bender et al., 2022; Kol-
jonen, 2023). These tools could also facilitate knowledge acquisition in 
complex scenarios, such as diabetic foot ulcer management or wound 
healing pattern recognition (Bender et al., 2022; Koljonen, 2023).
One study did not explicitly state student-related outcomes (Seth 
et al., 2024), focusing on the broader context of generative adversarial 
networks application in wound care education.
Regarding potential outcomes for educators, the included studies 
suggest multiple outcomes resulting from integrating artificial intelli-
gence in wound care education. A common outcome was the ability to 
combine traditional teaching methods with innovative artificial intelli-
gence technologies to enhance teaching efficiency and effectiveness 
(Prodan et al., 2009, 2010a, 2010b). Many studies highlighted artificial 
intelligence’s role in facilitating feedback-driven teaching strategies and 
providing tools for real-time student evaluation (Noraset et al., 2024; 
Ousey et al., 2018; Prodan et al., 2009). Teachers also benefited from 
tools that simplified progress tracking, customized evaluations, and 
performance assessments, enabling more adaptive and personalized 
teaching approaches (Morente et al., 2011; Morente and Veredas, 2013; 
Veredas et al., 2014).
Artificial intelligence technologies were further associated with 
reducing educators’ workload by automating teaching tasks and 
resource creation, such as quizzes, synthesized educational materials, 
and lesson plans (Heerschap, 2023). These tools allowed teachers to 
focus on other curricular aspects and refine their teaching strategies 
(Heerschap, 2023; Morente and Veredas, 2013). Additionally, artificial 
intelligence-enabled resources supported the development of interactive 
and ethically responsible teaching material, including privacy- 
compliant educational content (Koljonen, 2023).
Some studies highlighted specific tools for enhancing teaching effi-
ciency, such as apps for demonstrating wound staging and assessment 
(Lau et al., 2022) or reducing the time required to evaluate students’ 
suture practices (Noraset et al., 2024). Two studies did not explicitly 
report teacher outcomes (Bender et al., 2022; Seth et al., 2024).
3.4. Artificial intelligence within wound care education
The included studies highlight a diverse range of artificial intelli-
gence technologies and applications in wound care education, reflecting 
varying levels of complexity and functionality. The main functions 
include real-time feedback (Heerschap, 2023; Kil et al., 2024; Lau et al., 
2022; Noraset et al., 2024), automated assessment (Kil et al., 2024; 
Morente and Veredas, 2013; Noraset et al., 2024; Veredas et al., 2014), 
adaptive learning (Heerschap, 2023; Morente and Veredas, 2013; Pro-
dan et al., 2010a; Veredas et al., 2014), and interactive engagement 
(Heerschap, 2023; Kil et al., 2024; Lau et al., 2022; Ousey et al., 2018).
Artificial intelligence potential technologies to be used as teaching 
tools include expert systems, such as Bayesian inference and case-based 
reasoning (Bender et al., 2022; Prodan et al., 2010a), machine learning 
(Heerschap, 2023; Ousey et al., 2018; Morente et al., 2011), deep 
learning (Lau et al., 2022; Noraset et al., 2024), computational intelli-
gence (Morente et al., 2011; Morente and Veredas, 2013; Veredas et al., 
2014), and neural networks (Morente et al., 2011; Veredas et al., 2014). 
Specific applications also included computer vision techniques for 
wound image segmentation and tissue classification (Morente and Ver-
edas, 2013; Veredas et al., 2014), and suturing metrics extraction for 
performance evaluation (Kil et al., 2024).
Generative artificial intelligence tools, like DALL-E 2 (Open AI), Blue 
Willow (Lime Wire), and Midjourney (Midjourney, Inc.), were used to 
create realistic wound images and educational content while preserving 
patient privacy (Koljonen, 2023; Seth et al., 2024). Although generative 
adversarial networks like DALL-E2 (Open AI) and Midjourney (Mid-
journey, Inc.) produced lifelike images, limitations in accuracy and 
medical terminology recognition restricted their immediate applica-
bility in clinical education (Seth et al., 2024). However, their ability to 
create non-identifiable images presents opportunities for teaching while 
maintaining patient confidentiality and privacy (Koljonen, 2023).
Artificial intelligence technologies also contributed to personalized 
and adaptive learning experiences. Large language models like Open AI’s 
Chat GPT can simulate virtual patients and teaching assistants to provide 
real-time feedback, multilingual support, and tailored educational 
content (Heerschap, 2023).
Several studies emphasized the value of artificial intelligence-based 
frameworks and e-learning platforms in facilitating interactive and 
active learning.
Java tools incorporating artificial intelligence tools provided func-
tionalities for wound image analysis, tissue classification, and healing 
simulations, underscoring their potential to enhance diagnostic effi-
ciency and support simulation-based learning and clinical decision- 
making training in medical education (Prodan et al., 2009, 2010a).
Adaptive platforms outperformed traditional pressure ulcer training, 
significantly improving participants’ assessment skills on pressure ulcers 
(Morente and Veredas, 2013; Veredas et al., 2014). The effectiveness of 
these tools as adaptive educational platforms was validated through pre 
and post-test comparisons, demonstrating their potential capacity to 
enhance wound care learning outcomes. Positive feedback on their 
adaptive features and user-friendly interface further supported their 
educational impact.
Integrating artificial intelligence-powered simulations and interac-
tive technologies was highlighted as a potential innovation in wound 
care education. Virtual reality and augmented reality tools allowed the 
simulation of realistic wound care scenarios, combining haptic, visual, 
and auditory feedback to improve nurses’ clinical skills in dynamic and 
interactive settings (Ousey et al., 2018). Artificial intelligence supported 
the creation of e-learning scenarios designed for active learning envi-
ronments, incorporating feedback mechanisms, visual recognition, and 
interactive decision-making to enhance students’ clinical skills and

understanding of wound image analysis (Morente and Veredas, 2013; 
Prodan et al., 2010a; Veredas et al., 2014).
In another study, case-based reasoning systems matched new wound 
cases with historical data, offering evidence-based diagnostic and 
treatment recommendations, and potentially enhancing nurses’ 
competence and decision-making (Bender et al., 2022).
Other artificial intelligence tools included a smartphone application 
using deep learning algorithms for real-time wound detection and 
classification, which could improve students’ motivations and skills in 
wound assessment and staging (Lau et al., 2022).
These technologies had the potential to enable progressive education 
by tailoring content to user performance (Morente et al., 2011; Morente 
and Veredas, 2013; Veredas et al., 2014), facilitating collaborative 
evaluation, and providing automated metrics for skill assessment 
(Heerschap, 2023; Kil et al., 2024; Noraset et al., 2024). In surgical 
contexts, artificial intelligence tools for skill evaluation and feedback 
objectively assess suturing precision with a high correlation to human 
measurements (Kil et al., 2024; Noraset et al., 2024). These tools 
enhanced training by offering real-time feedback and objectivity in skill 
assessment.
Data presented in the included studies regarding artificial intelli-
gence validation and testing metrics was limited. One study presented 
artificial intelligence validation and testing metrics, reporting a global 
accuracy of 91.5 % for tissue classification (Morente et al., 2011). 
Another study demonstrated an overall prediction accuracy of 63.2 %, 
with high specificity (85.1 %–100 %) but variable sensitivity (55.6 %– 
73.3 %) for wound detection and staging (Lau et al., 2022). Other studies 
assessed artificial intelligence-generated images’ validity and realism 
through expert judgment and pre/post-test evaluations (Kil et al., 2024; 
Koljonen, 2023; Morente and Veredas, 2013). Several studies did not 
explicitly mention artificial intelligence metrics or validation, relying 
instead on inferred effectiveness or user feedback (Bender et al., 2022; 
Ousey et al., 2018; Prodan et al., 2010a; Veredas et al., 2014).
Regulatory approvals were not addressed, and interoperability was 
only mentioned in Java-based tools, highlighting their potential for 
integration with web-based systems (Prodan et al., 2008b, 2010a, 
2010b).
4. Discussion
This scoping review highlights the transformative potential of arti-
ficial intelligence in wound care education, demonstrating its capacity 
to enhance skill development, promote interactive learning, and support 
evidence-based decision-making. The studies reviewed described 
diverse artificial intelligence applications, including adaptive e-learning 
platforms, virtual reality and augmented reality simulations embedded 
with artificial intelligence, generative artificial intelligence for educa-
tional content, and diagnostic tools. These technologies enable person-
alized learning experiences by tailoring content to individual student 
needs and providing real-time feedback to refine clinical skills, aligning 
with existing literature on artificial intelligence’s ability to deliver dy-
namic, immersive, and personalized educational experiences (Chiu 
et al., 2023; De Gagne, 2023; Preiksaitis and Rose, 2023).
Several studies underscored the role of artificial intelligence in 
fostering active learning and practical experiences by integrating real- 
world scenarios into e-learning platforms. Advanced artificial intelli-
gence paradigms such as Bayesian inference, case-based reasoning, and 
intelligent agents enhance students’ abilities to analyze wound images, 
identify critical healing barriers (e.g., infection, inflammation, and 
moisture imbalance), and improve diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, 
artificial intelligence-generated images emerged as innovative tools for 
pattern recognition and clinical case discussions, preserving patient 
privacy and supporting learning objectives. Smartphone-based appli-
cations and large language models, such as Chat GPT (Open AI), 
demonstrated their potential to offer accessible and personalized 
content.
Despite these advancements, this review highlights several chal-
lenges and limitations. Most included studies focused on system devel-
opment and conceptual frameworks, lacking empirical assessments of 
their outcomes. This focus on preliminary designs limits the generaliz-
ability and applicability of findings to real-world educational contexts. 
To address these challenges, future research should adopt mixed-method 
approaches, combining qualitative and quantitative evaluations to 
assess the effectiveness of artificial intelligence tools in improving 
wound care education. Additionally, pilot programs, longitudinal 
studies, and collaborations with software developers could be imple-
mented to test usability, refine algorithms, and ensure seamless inte-
gration into curricula. Artificial intelligence tools also demonstrated 
promising results (Morente and Veredas, 2013; Veredas et al., 2014). 
Still, their evaluations were based on small sample sizes or narrow ap-
plications, such as pressure ulcer management, constraining their 
broader clinical relevance.
Technical and usability challenges also emerged as critical barriers to 
implementation. Issues such as long processing times, high storage de-
mands, and interoperability constraints may hinder the scalability of 
artificial intelligence tools in educational settings. Potential strategies to 
address these challenges include collaborating with software developers 
to optimize algorithms for efficiency, conducting pilot testing in diverse 
academic environments to identify usability gaps, and employing cloud- 
based infrastructures to manage storage and processing requirements. 
Furthermore, a notable lack of artificial intelligence evaluation metrics, 
including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, was observed in many 
studies. To improve reliability, studies should incorporate standardized 
validation protocols and performance benchmarks. Only a few studies 
reported validation outcomes (Lau et al., 2022; Morente et al., 2011), 
highlighting the need for more rigorous testing and transparent 
reporting. The absence of regulatory approvals and explicit discussions 
on compliance raises additional concerns about artificial intelligence 
safety, reliability, and ethical integration in wound care education.
The integration of artificial intelligence into nursing education de-
mands critical attention to its ethical, legal, and social implications. Bias 
resulting from non-representative training datasets can lead to inaccu-
rate predictions, particularly for marginalized or minority groups, 
thereby reinforcing structural inequities (Glauberman et al., 2023; 
Dunlap and Michalowski, 2024). This concern is especially relevant in 
healthcare education, where simulations and decision-support tools risk 
becoming misleading if developed without considering demographic 
diversity.
Furthermore, the opacity of AI systems undermines trust and com-
promises the ability of educators and clinicians to validate outputs, 
while potential data privacy breaches threaten the rights of students and 
patients (WHO, 2021; Ghane et al., 2024). These challenges are exac-
erbated when institutions lack governance mechanisms to ensure data 
quality, traceability, and accountability.
Despite these risks, AI can also serve as a tool to reduce harm if 
designed and implemented with ethical safeguards. The use of inclusive 
and high-quality datasets, adherence to principles of explainability and 
transparency, and the establishment of clear responsibility structures are 
essential for safe deployment (ANA, 2022; Dunlap and Michalowski, 
2024). Institutions and educators must adopt a proactive role in guiding 
the ethical integration of AI, ensuring that its use aligns with the foun-
dational nursing values of safety, equity, and human dignity.
4.1. Practical implications and challenges
Artificial intelligence technologies have implications for both stu-
dents and educators. Tools like large language models and generative 
artificial intelligence can reduce educators’ workloads by automating 
tasks such as creating teaching materials and providing multilingual 
educational support (Hobensack et al., 2024; Lee, 2024). Chatbots have 
emerged as valuable tools for fostering engagement, providing effective 
feedback, and enabling educators to track students’ progress and 
R. Encarnaç˜ao et al.

identify areas for improvement (Goktas et al., 2024; Tam et al., 2023; 
Zhang et al., 2024). However, their effectiveness depends on their ability 
to adapt to learners’ needs while maintaining accuracy and reliability.
Artificial intelligence technologies have the potential to enhance 
knowledge acquisition and clinical skills, but concerns remain regarding 
their impact on clinical decision-making (Gerlich, 2025). Educators fear 
that an overreliance on artificial intelligence could negatively impact 
the development of students’ critical thinking and problem-solving 
abilities (Lee, 2024; Tam et al., 2023). Similar concerns have been 
raised in other healthcare contexts, where the efficacy of artificial in-
telligence tools depends on the quality of training datasets and extensive 
testing (Sallam, 2023). In wound care education, high-quality data is 
essential to minimize biases in artificial intelligence algorithms, which 
could otherwise distort educational content.
Addressing the ethical considerations of artificial intelligence, 
including algorithm transparency, interpretability, and accountability, 
is needed. Ensuring educators have sufficient technological skills and 
support to integrate artificial intelligence tools into their teaching 
practices is critical for successful implementation.
The ethical deployment of AI in education requires more than 
technical competence; it demands a robust culture of data literacy and 
critical reflection among educators and institutions. Nurse educators 
must be equipped not only to use AI tools but to recognize their limi-
tations, mitigate algorithmic risks, and ensure equitable learning expe-
riences (Dunlap and Michalowski, 2024). The American Nurses 
Association (ANA, 2022) emphasizes the importance of safeguarding 
patient privacy, upholding transparency, and preserving core nursing 
values, including compassion and human connection. Likewise, the 
Nursing and Artificial Intelligence Leadership (NAIL) Collaborative 
emphasizes the importance of empowering nurses to take leading roles 
in shaping the ethical adoption of AI across practice and education 
(Glauberman et al., 2023).
4.2. Future directions
The swift integration of artificial intelligence into wound care edu-
cation signals a transformative era, yet it also raises critical questions 
that demand a thorough investigation. Future research must assess the 
immediate educational benefits and examine the long-term effects of 
artificial intelligence on student performance, instructor-student dy-
namics, and ethical considerations.
A crucial priority for future studies lies in evaluating the effective-
ness of artificial intelligence-based educational tools in enhancing core 
competencies, including knowledge retention, diagnostic accuracy, 
problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and clinical decision- 
making. These assessments should utilize robust methodologies, inte-
grating qualitative and quantitative approaches to capture nuanced 
educational outcomes. Furthermore, research must broaden its scope by 
encompassing a wider range of wound types, including complex chronic 
and atypical presentations, and by incorporating larger, more diverse 
samples to strengthen generalizability across various educational and 
cultural contexts.
Artificial intelligence’s potential to personalize learning experiences, 
simulate clinical scenarios, and provide real-time feedback opens 
exciting avenues for pedagogical innovation. However, its imple-
mentation also introduces pressing ethical dilemmas, particularly 
regarding privacy, algorithmic transparency, and bias. Sharing sensitive 
patient information among students, educators, and healthcare pro-
fessionals underscores the need for comprehensive data governance 
frameworks. Establishing standardized protocols for data security, 
algorithmic accountability, and informed consent is paramount to 
fostering trust and upholding ethical standards in artificial intelligence- 
enhanced education.
Furthermore, future investigations should examine artificial in-
telligence’s potential to bridge global wound care education gaps by 
providing scalable solutions for underserved regions. Adaptive learning 
platforms and virtual simulations could democratize access to special-
ized knowledge, thus reducing disparities in healthcare training 
worldwide.
Moreover, the implementation of AI across diverse educational and 
geographical contexts presents several challenges. The integration of AI- 
based tools requires not only technological infrastructure but also cur-
riculum redesign to align with AI-supported pedagogies. The absence of 
AI literacy among teachers creates a significant barrier to the effective 
integration of AI in the classroom (Rinc´on et al., 2025; Tan et al., 2025). 
This highlights the need to equip educators with specific competencies 
to critically use, interpret, and integrate these tools into their teaching 
practices. Simultaneously, institutions must allocate dedicated re-
sources, which can be financially demanding, for ongoing technical 
support and maintenance to ensure the sustainable adoption of these 
solutions.
In geographically diverse settings, disparities in access to digital 
infrastructure are particularly concerning. Institutions in low- and 
middle-income countries may lack stable internet connectivity, modern 
hardware, or secure data systems necessary for AI deployment (Rinc´on 
et al., 2025). Additionally, varying levels of digital literacy among ed-
ucators and students may affect adoption and engagement, particularly 
in contexts where professional development in educational technologies 
is limited.
Language barriers and cultural variations may further influence the 
acceptance and usability of AI tools, especially those relying on natural 
language processing or region-specific clinical content. In multicultural 
contexts, disparities in proficiency with the AI’s default language, 
without proper linguistic support, can hinder students’ learning expe-
riences and compromise educational outcomes (Lifshits and Rosenberg, 
2024). Ethical and regulatory considerations, such as equitable access, 
also present ongoing concerns. To enable the effective and responsible 
use of AI in wound care education, implementation strategies must 
address these practical and systemic issues, ensuring that tools are 
adaptable, inclusive, and responsive to the diverse needs of various 
learning environments worldwide. Therefore, future initiatives must 
address these disparities by promoting the development of flexible, 
context-aware, and linguistically accessible platforms.
In this regard, AI systems must be developed and deployed with a 
priority on inclusivity, transparency, and cultural sensitivity. This is 
particularly relevant in wound care education, where clinical pre-
sentations and management practices may vary widely depending on 
regional epidemiology, healthcare resources, and patient demographics. 
Taking this into consideration, institutions can enhance the quality of 
training while ensuring that learners across diverse settings are equally 
equipped to assess, classify, and manage wounds in diverse clinical 
scenarios.
To fully realize artificial intelligence’s transformative potential, 
interdisciplinary collaboration among educators, engineers, clinicians, 
data scientists, and ethicists must be encouraged. These partnerships can 
drive the joint creation of artificial intelligence systems that are not only 
technologically advanced but also ethically sound and culturally sensi-
tive. Ultimately, advancing artificial intelligence in wound care educa-
tion will require a delicate balance between innovation and integrity. 
This approach prioritizes human values while leveraging machine in-
telligence to enhance learning experiences and improve patient 
outcomes.
4.3. Limitations
Although this scoping review was conducted following the JBI 
methodology, a few limitations exist. The restriction of studies pub-
lished in English, Portuguese, and Spanish may have excluded relevant 
research in other languages, although no studies were excluded based on 
country of origin.
The findings may have constrained applicability and transferability 
to healthcare systems, educational environments, or regions with 
R. Encarnaç˜ao et al.

distinct practices, cultural frameworks, and resource availability. Vari-
ations in institutional priorities, regulatory standards, and technological 
infrastructure could further influence the generalizability of the results. 
Future studies should seek to incorporate multilingual sources and 
examine settings with broader contextual diversity to enhance the 
robustness and global relevance of the findings.
Future developments should prioritize the creation of inclusive and 
high-quality datasets, alongside the development of tailored ethical 
frameworks for nursing education. A data-centric approach to 
AI—shifting the focus from model optimization to the quality, fairness, 
and governance of data—has been proposed as a critical strategy to 
build responsible and sustainable AI solutions (Dunlap and Michalowski, 
2024). Such strategies demand collaboration among diverse stake-
holders, including patients, educators, community representatives, and 
ethics experts, to ensure that AI technologies enhance—not com-
promise—human dignity and patient safety.
5. Conclusions
This scoping review highlights artificial intelligence’s potential to 
transform wound care education, offering innovative approaches to 
teaching and learning. However, several limitations and gaps in the 
current literature emphasize the need for further research to establish 
artificial intelligence efficacy and practical application in this field. The 
generalizability of these findings is limited due to the small number of 
included studies, the emerging nature of this topic, and the specificity of 
the contexts in which the studies were conducted.
A balanced approach is crucial, integrating artificial intelligence 
technologies as complementary tools rather than replacements for 
traditional educational methods. Comprehensive evaluations are needed 
to assess the impact of these tools on student outcomes, including 
knowledge retention, problem-solving abilities, and critical thinking 
skills. The challenge lies in preserving academic integrity while vali-
dating the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in wound care 
education.
The integration of artificial intelligence must be guided by empirical 
evidence, ethical considerations, and a commitment to preserving the 
human elements of medical practice. By addressing existing challenges, 
artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize wound care ed-
ucation, equipping healthcare professionals with the skills and knowl-
edge to improve wound diagnosis, treatment, and management, 
ultimately enhancing patient care quality.
Nevertheless, as AI becomes further integrated into nursing 
curricula, it is imperative to ensure that innovation does not outpace 
ethical safeguards. Educational strategies must balance technological 
advancement with humanistic values, reinforcing trust, inclusivity, and 
professional accountability.
