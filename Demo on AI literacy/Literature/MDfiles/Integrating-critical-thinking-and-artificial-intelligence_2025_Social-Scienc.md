This study examines the academic landscape on integrating artificial intelligence and critical thinking in higher 
education, revealing conceptualizations, competencies required by students, challenges and recommended 
learning strategies. The study employs a bibliometric analysis approach combined with a systematic literature 
review as a qualitative approach. A total of 640 documents were retrieved from the Scopus database using the 
query: (“critical thinking” AND (“artificial intelligence” OR AI) AND (“higher education” OR university OR 
college)), accessed on July 10, 2025. The dataset was limited to 2023–2025, reflecting the period following the 
widespread adoption of Chat GPT and similar generative AI tools in academic contexts. From this, 290 documents 
were selected for bibliometric analysis, and 23 were in-depth synthesized based on established inclusion criteria. 
The findings reveal a growing consolidation of research on AI and critical thinking, driven by a small group of 
highly influential authors and concentrated in prominent interdisciplinary journals. Five thematic clusters were 
identified: pedagogical innovation, psychological dimensions, academic ethics, systemic integration, and AI- 
related literacies. Emerging research directions include personalized learning, digital literacy, engineering ed-
ucation, and ethical AI applications. Critical thinking is conceptualized as a purposeful, evaluative, and self- 
regulated process that must be preserved despite increasing reliance on AI tools. Key challenges include un-
critical dependence on AI, digital literacy disparities, lack of system transparency, and institutional limitations. 
The study highlights the need for inclusive and adaptive instructional frameworks that integrate AI in ways that 
support critical thinking in diverse higher education settings.
1. Introduction
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is bringing 
significant changes to higher education. It reshapes how instructors 
design and delivers instruction, what students are expected to learn, and 
how they engage in the learning process (Farooq et al., 2024). Tech-
nologies such as adaptive learning platforms, automated feedback sys-
tems, and generative models like Chat GPT offer opportunities for more 
personalized, scalable, and accessible education (Nikolopoulou, 2024). 
However, while these technologies promise pedagogical benefits, they 
pose serious challenges related to students’ cognitive development, 
ethical reasoning, and academic integrity (Francis et al., 2025). The 
increasing reliance on AI tools raises concerns about diminished 
reflective engagement, bias in algorithmic outputs, and the erosion of 
independent thought. Furthermore, integrating AI in higher education 
must be approached with critical attention to digital inequality, data 
privacy, and the potential for reinforcing systemic disparities (Bobula, 
2024; Boratkar & Sambhe, 2024).
Critical thinking remains a foundational competency in higher edu-
cation, enabling students to make reasoned decisions, solve complex

problems, and evaluate diverse forms of information (Paul & Elder, 
2019). Ennis (2018) defines critical thinking as a logical and reflective 
process to decide what to believe or do, emphasizing deliberation and 
rational judgment. Paul and Elder (2019) conceptualize it as purposeful 
and self-regulatory thinking, guided by intellectual standards such as 
clarity, relevance, and consistency. Facione (2011) elaborates on this by 
identifying six core skills: interpretation, analysis, inference, evaluation, 
explanation, and self-regulation. These dimensions collectively support 
learners in processing arguments, assessing evidence, and articulating 
justifications. Complementary perspectives highlight the need for dis-
tinguishing valid information (Tathahira, 2020), engaging in reflective 
reasoning (Sachdeva & Eggen, 2021), and applying systematic logic and 
scientific principles (Lau, 2011). These critical thinking skills are rele-
vant and indispensable in AI-mediated learning environments, where 
students frequently interact with algorithmically generated outputs. 
Without intentional instructional design, the efficiency of AI tools may 
foster surface-level engagement and undermine the development of 
deep, analytical reasoning (Sarwanti et al., 2024; Walter, 2024).
Despite the growing integration of AI in academic settings, there 
remains a lack of conceptual and empirical clarity regarding its impact 
on the cultivation of critical thinking. While AI tools may assist in 
higher-order thinking, they also risk reducing the mental effort required 
for rigorous analysis, particularly when used without pedagogical scaf-
folding (Gonsalves, 2024; Panit, 2024). This dual function poses a crit-
ical dilemma for higher education: to what extent can AI be leveraged to 
enhance rather than erode students’ capacity for independent and 
reflective thought (Gonsalves, 2024). There is a pressing need to 
examine how critical thinking is defined across AI-related educational 
literature, to identify the specific challenges AI presents to cognitive 
development, and to explore instructional strategies that address these 
challenges without compromising intellectual rigor. Ensuring that AI 
integration aligns with the fundamental goals of higher education re-
quires a careful synthesis of theoretical and practical insights.
Several recent reviews have examined the influence of artificial in-
telligence on higher education, particularly its impact on students’ 
critical thinking skills. Melisa et al. (2025) employed a systematic 
literature review, while Raitskaya and Tikhonova (2025) adopted a 
scoping review, both demonstrating that generative tools such as 
Chat GPT facilitate idea generation, argument construction, and meta-
cognitive awareness. Nevertheless, these tools can impede sustained 
reflection when educators fail to provide adequate guidance. Using a 
narrative review, Papaneophytou and Nicolaou (2025) underscored the 
significance of contextual reasoning and ethical decision-making in 
AI-supported scientific learning. Similarly, Deroncele-Acosta et al. 
(2025) conducted a systematic literature review and identified critical 
thinking as a transversal competency shaped by AI, particularly within 
sustainability-focused curricula. Although these studies contribute 
valuable insights, they remain constrained by narrow temporal sco-
pes—some limiting their coverage to 2023–2024 or omitting timeframes 
entirely—and by methodological designs that separate quantitative 
mapping of research patterns from qualitative synthesis of pedagogical 
practices. Consequently, the existing body of research does not yet 
provide a comprehensive, methodologically integrated understanding of 
how AI influences the definition, development, and support of critical 
thinking in higher education.
To address these gaps, the present study adopts a dual methodo-
logical framework that combines bibliometric mapping and systematic 
literature review. By focusing on Scopus-indexed publications from 
2023 to 2025—the formative period following the public release of 
Chat GPT in late 2022—this research captures the earliest patterns of 
scholarly engagement with generative AI in higher education (Michalon 
& Camacho-Zu˜niga, 2023). The study offers a novel contribution by 
integrating multidisciplinary perspectives from education, computer 
science, and social sciences, enabling a broad yet coherent analysis of 
the topic. Bibliometric mapping identifies publication trends, influential 
authors, key journals, institutions, thematic clusters, and emerging 
research themes. At the same time, the systematic review examines 
conceptualizations of critical thinking, core competencies, pedagogical 
challenges, and instructional strategies relevant to AI-enhanced learning 
environments. This integrated approach addresses the limitations of 
single-method reviews by offering a macro-level mapping of research 
developments and a micro-level synthesis of strategies to foster critical 
thinking in AI-enhanced learning environments in higher education.
Guided by this approach, the study aims to map the academic 
landscape at the intersection of artificial intelligence and critical 
thinking, and to generate evidence-based insights that can inform cur-
riculum design and pedagogical practices. To guide the analysis, the 
study addresses the following research questions: 
1. What are the characteristics of the publication landscape and the-
matic trends in studies on AI and critical thinking in higher education 
from 2023 to 2025?
2. What conceptualizations of critical thinking and associated student 
skills are emphasized in the existing literature?
3. What challenges are identified in promoting critical thinking in AI- 
integrated higher education?
4. What instructional strategies are recommended to foster critical 
thinking in AI-supported learning environments?
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design
This study adopted a dual-method approach, combining bibliometric 
analysis and systematic literature review to examine the integration of 
artificial intelligence and critical thinking in higher education. The 
bibliometric component aimed to map the research landscape, while the 
systematic review sought to synthesize key challenges, conceptual 
frameworks, student competencies, and instructional strategies. The 
Scopus database was selected as the sole data source due to its extensive 
indexing of peer-reviewed and high-impact academic literature across 
multiple disciplines, ensuring both breadth and scholarly rigor. This 
approach allows for quantitative insight into publication patterns and 
qualitative interpretation of research themes.
2.2. Search strategy
The search was conducted on July 10, 2025, using the search query: 
(“critical thinking” AND (“artificial intelligence” OR AI) AND (“higher 
education” OR university OR college)). This initial search yielded 640 
documents. To ensure relevance to the period after the public release of 
Chat GPT and the growing integration of AI in educational contexts, the 
search was restricted to publications from 2023 to 2025 (Michalon & 
Camacho-Zu˜niga, 2023; Mir´on-M´erida & García-García, 2024). Addi-
tional filters were applied to retain only journal articles, excluding 
conference proceedings, book chapters, and other non-peer-reviewed 
literature. Although certain conference proceedings—particularly in 
computer science education—undergo rigorous selection processes, 
many do not follow a standardized peer-review protocol, resulting in 
inconsistent methodological rigor and limited long-term citability. To 
ensure the reliability and comparability of the analyzed literature, such 
sources were excluded from the dataset. The results were further limited 
to documents in the final publication stage, resulting in 290 articles for 
bibliometric analysis. This filtering strategy was intended to focus the 
analysis on peer-reviewed journal sources, which are generally consid-
ered to offer higher methodological rigor and relevance for scholarly 
discourse. By excluding proceedings and other document types, this 
study presents a more straightforward overview of relevant publication 
trends and sources that may serve as potential outlets for researchers 
submitting empirical work on this topic.

2.3. Selection process
The selection process for the bibliometric analysis was confined to 
publications from 2023 to 2025, restricted to peer-reviewed journal 
articles to ensure methodological rigor, and further limited to docu-
ments in the final publication stage. This process yielded 290 records for 
analysis. In parallel, the selection process for the systematic review 
followed the PRISMA guidelines Moher et al. (2016) through four pha-
ses: identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion, as presented in 
Fig. 1. Initially, 560 documents published between 2023 and 2025 were 
identified. Filtering by document type (articles only) reduced the pool to 
330, and further limiting to the final publication stage yielded 290 
documents. Applying a language filter (English only) resulted in 276 
articles, from which only open-access publications were retained to 
ensure full-text availability, narrowing the dataset to 132 articles. 
Keyword filtering was then applied to include only documents explicitly 
listing “critical thinking”, producing 26 articles. A final full-text review 
was conducted to exclude review articles, leading to the inclusion of 22 
empirical studies in the systematic analysis. This decision was made 
through an internal consensus process among the three review authors, 
with two supporting the exclusion of review articles to maintain focus on 
original empirical research, while one recommended their inclusion.
2.4. Data analysis
The bibliometric analysis was conducted using Biblioshiny R and 
VOSviewer software. These tools enabled the comprehensive extraction 
and visualization of metadata, including citation networks, keyword co- 
occurrences, author affiliations, and thematic clusters. This analysis 
offers insights into the publication landscape, including impactful au-
thors, relevant journal sources, relevant institutions, emerging themes, 
and potential directions for future research. Meanwhile, the systematic 
literature review employed a deductive thematic analysis approach, as 
outlined by Nowell et al. (2017), to identify and categorize themes 
aligned with the research questions. Three research team members 
independently reviewed the 22 included articles and conducted the-
matic coding manually, without using specialized qualitative software 
such as NVivo. Minor discrepancies in coding terminology were resolved 
through discussion and consensus. The thematic synthesis was 
organized into three categories: (1) conceptualizations of critical 
thinking and associated student competencies in the AI era, (2) chal-
lenges in developing critical thinking in AI-enhanced environments, and 
(3) proposed instructional strategies to foster critical thinking alongside 
AI integration.
3. Results
The findings of this study comprise two primary aspects: (1) an 
overview of the publication landscape on critical thinking in the era of 
AI in higher education and (2) a synthesis of research on the integration 
of AI in the development of critical thinking skills in higher education. 
The publication landscape analysis includes the identification of influ-
ential authors, key journal sources, leading institutional affiliations, 
dominant research themes, and emerging topics that hold potential for 
future exploration. Meanwhile, the synthesis of research findings pre-
sents an overview of the conceptualization of critical thinking, the 
competencies required by students, the challenges, and strategies for 
developing critical thinking skills in the AI era. These findings provide a 
broad analytical perspective, offering critical insights into the research 
theme.

finding indicates a strong convergence between author impact and the 
prominence of specific journals within the discourse on AI and critical 
thinking in higher education.
Table 2 lists the top 10 journal sources publishing research on arti-
ficial intelligence and critical thinking in higher education from 2023 to 
2025, based on data retrieved from Scopus. Education and Information 
Technologies and Education Sciences are the most prolific sources, each 
contributing 15 publications. These journals are primary outlets for 
disseminating research at the intersection of digital innovation and 
pedagogical development. Environment and Social Psychology and the 
Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching follow with eight articles, 
indicating growing interdisciplinary interest in the subject. Other sig-
nificant sources include Cogent Education and Frontiers in Education 
with seven articles each, and the Journal of Information Technology 
Education: Research with six. Electronic Journal of E-Learning, Ad-
vances in Physiology Education, and Computers and Education: Artifi-
cial Intelligence round out the list with four to five articles each. The 
presence of these journals focusing on education and the domain of 
teaching and technology demonstrates that these topics are relevant 
across various educational contexts, from general pedagogy to special-
ized areas such as digital learning and subject-based instruction. 
Furthermore, the top 10 relevant affiliations of the corresponding au-
thors in this field are presented in Table 3.
Table 3 presents the top 10 institutional affiliations of corresponding 
authors contributing to research on artificial intelligence and critical 
thinking in higher education during the 2023–2025. King Saud Uni-
versity ranks first with 13 publications, indicating its central role in 
advancing discourse in this domain. Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal 
University follows this with 10 publications, European University 
Cyprus and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology with 
nine each. A cluster of institutions, including Mindanao State University- 
Sulu, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Technical 
University of Liberec, and Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta, contributed 
eight articles respectively. Edith Cowan University and Hong Kong 
Metropolitan University round out the list with seven articles each. The 
geographic diversity of these institutions—from the Middle East and 
Southeast Asia to Europe and Africa—reflects the global relevance and 
collaborative potential of AI and critical thinking research in higher 
education. Further analysis using keyword linkage networks is presented 
in Figs. 2 and 3.
Fig. 2 illustrates the keyword co-occurrence network generated using 
VOSviewer, based on 59 refined keywords with a minimum occurrence 
of four. The analysis reveals five thematic clusters that characterize 
current research trends on artificial intelligence and critical thinking in 
higher education. Cluster 1 (red) focuses on pedagogical integration, 
featuring critical thinking, generative AI, assessment, curriculum, and 
large language model, indicating attention to instructional design and 
evaluation. Cluster 2 (green) emphasizes psychological and learner at-
tributes, including creativity, motivation, machine learning, and de-
mographic variables. Cluster 3 (blue) highlights ethical concerns like 
academic integrity, plagiarism, and academic writing. Cluster 4 (yellow) 
reflects broader contexts with keywords like artificial intelligence, 
higher education, educational innovation, and digital competence. 
Finally, Cluster 5 (purple) centers on AI literacy, digital literacy, and 
students’ perception, signaling a growing emphasis on preparing stu-
dents for critical engagement with AI technologies. Meanwhile, the 
overlay visualization analysis related to the latest keywords is presented 
in Fig. 3.
Fig. 3 presents the overlay visualization of keyword co-occurrences, 
illustrating the temporal evolution of research themes on artificial in-
telligence and critical thinking in higher education. The color gradient 
reflects the average publication year of documents associated with each 
keyword, with yellow indicating the most recent topics. The most recent 
emerging keywords include curriculum, digital literacy, personalized 
learning, AI tools, engineering education, educational technology, dig-
ital competence, collaborative learning, procedures, EFL, and ethics. 
These findings suggest a growing scholarly interest in pedagogical 
strategies, technological adaptation, and ethical considerations within 
AI-enhanced learning contexts.

(Michalon & Camacho-Zu˜niga, 2023)—other authors emphasize the 
practical application of critical thinking in navigating AI-generated in-
formation (Alam et al., 2023; Van den Berg & Du Plessis, 2023). A 
common conceptual thread is that critical thinking involves evaluative 
reasoning, reflective skepticism, and the ability to analyze and interpret 
complex information in rapidly evolving digital environments 
(Chaparro-Banegas et al., 2024; Essel et al., 2024; Xu & Jumaat, 2024). 
Even studies without explicit theoretical grounding consistently high-
light critical thinking as essential for ethical engagement with AI tech-
nologies, thoughtful decision-making, and intellectual autonomy 
(Darwin et al., 2024; Giray, 2024; Murtiningsih et al., 2024).
Across the studies, several recurring competencies emerge as 
necessary for maintaining and enhancing critical thinking in AI- 
supported learning contexts. Among these are advanced information 
and AI literacy, including the ability to verify, interpret, and assess the 
credibility of AI-generated content (Qi et al., 2025; Youssef et al., 2024; 
Zhou et al., 2024). Self-regulated learning is also emphasized, particu-
larly the capacity to plan, monitor, and reflect on one’s cognitive pro-
cesses when engaging with AI tools (Essel et al., 2024; Liu & Tu, 2024). 
Other competencies include prompt engineering, reflective communi-
cation, and digital health literacy—each of which supports students in 
becoming active, critical users of AI rather than passive recipients of 
automated output (Michalon & Camacho-Zu˜niga, 2023; Tsopra et al., 
2023; Xu & Jumaat, 2024). Several authors also stress ethical awareness, 
academic honesty, and collaborative adaptability as essential in pre-
serving human-centered values in AI-mediated educational settings 
(Kharis et al., 2024; Murtiningsih et al., 2024; Ruiz-Rojas et al., 2024).
Furthermore, some studies highlight discipline-specific manifesta-
tions of critical thinking, such as clinical reasoning in digital health 
(Tsopra et al., 2023) or translation accuracy in language studies (Mahdi 
& Sahari, 2024), without always specifying the required skills. Others 
reveal implicit concerns about over-reliance on AI, suggesting the need 
for students to develop resilience against cognitive automation by 
nurturing deeper analytical habits and critical engagement with digital 
tools (Giray, 2024; ˇSedlbauer et al., 2024). The literature suggests that 
cultivating critical thinking in the AI era demands a fusion of evaluative 
reasoning, ethical discernment, and digital competence, underscoring 
the urgency of embedding these competencies into curricula across 
disciplines.
3.3. Challenges in fostering critical thinking in AI-integrated higher 
education
The results of the synthesis of 22 documents that identify the chal-
lenges in fostering critical thinking within AI-integrated higher educa-
tion environments are presented in Table 5.
The studies reviewed in Table 5 consistently emphasize that over- 
reliance on AI-generated content is a critical barrier to developing in-
dependent and reflective thinking among students. Many authors report 
that students tend to accept AI outputs without adequate evaluation, 
which diminishes cognitive engagement and reduces opportunities for 
deep reasoning and self-correction (Michalon & Camacho-Zu˜niga, 2023; 
Xu & Jumaat, 2024; Zhou et al., 2024). Furthermore, several works 
highlight that AI responses often contain inaccuracies, fabricated ref-
erences, or biased information, posing significant risks of misinforma-
tion and plagiarism if left unexamined (Alam et al., 2023; Essel et al., 
2024; Mir´on-M´erida & García-García, 2024). These concerns are com-
pounded by the lack of transparency in AI systems, which frequently 
provide untraceable or unverifiable sources, making it difficult for stu-
dents to assess the reliability of information (Van den Berg & Du Plessis, 
2023; Giray, 2024). Additionally, disparities in students’ digital literacy 
and prompting capabilities contribute to uneven critical engagement 
with AI tools, with some students unable to distinguish between high- 
and low-quality content (Chaparro-Banegas et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2025).
Psychological and structural challenges also surface in multiple 
studies. Anxiety regarding AI usage negatively correlates with students’

willingness to engage critically, as fear of misuse or misunderstanding 
may inhibit active exploration (Mahdi & Sahari, 2024). At the same 
time, AI tools’ inability to interpret human nuance—such as irony, 
emotion, or cultural context—limits their effectiveness in fostering deep, 
context-aware thinking (Darwin et al., 2024; Fakour & Imani, 2025). 
Institutional factors such as lack of faculty training, infrastructure 
inequality, and insufficient ethical frameworks further hinder efforts to 
integrate AI without compromising academic integrity and cognitive 
rigor (Chaparro-Banegas et al., 2024; Tsopra et al., 2023). These findings 
indicate that critical thinking development in AI-enhanced education 
requires student-level cognitive strategies and systemic interventions in 
pedagogy, faculty capacity building, and AI governance.
3.4. Instructional strategies for enhancing critical thinking in AI-supported 
learning environments
Table 6 shows the results of synthesizing 22 documents presenting 
instructional strategies to enhance critical thinking in AI-supported 
learning environments.
The synthesis of 22 studies in Table 6 reveals a diverse yet conver-
gent set of instructional strategies to foster critical thinking in AI- 
supported learning environments. Many authors emphasize the impor-
tance of combining traditional pedagogical methods with AI-enhanced 
approaches to promote reflective, analytical, and independent 
thinking (Van den Berg & Du Plessis, 2023; Fakour & Imani, 2025; 
Ruiz-Rojas et al., 2024). Strategies such as integrating structured de-
bates, real-world problem-based projects, and co-created learning 
spaces are proposed to cultivate students’ active engagement and 
cognitive autonomy (Cook, 2025; Mir´on-M´erida & García-García, 2024; 
Tsopra et al., 2023). Several studies highlight the necessity of embed-
ding critical thinking explicitly into AI literacy curricula and leveraging 
AI tools like Chat GPT to support, rather than replace, reasoning pro-
cesses (Michalon & Camacho-Zu˜niga, 2023; Qi et al., 2025; Xu & 
Jumaat, 2024). A shared emphasis is also placed on the role of guided 
prompt engineering, reflective use of generative AI, and structured 
feedback mechanisms to deepen student inquiry and conceptual un-
derstanding (Essel et al., 2024; Michalon & Camacho-Zu˜niga, 2023; 
Zhou et al., 2024).
Ethical and regulatory considerations are another recurring focus. 
Many authors advocate for the development of institutional policies, 
educator training, and curricular interventions to ensure responsible and 
transparent AI use (Alam et al., 2023; Chaparro-Banegas et al., 2024; 
Murtiningsih et al., 2024). Reducing AI-related anxiety and fostering 
positive attitudes are essential for meaningful engagement, especially in 
translation and language learning (Mahdi & Sahari, 2024; Youssef et al., 
2024). Practical strategies such as oral presentations, video-based tasks, 
and in-class assignments are also recommended to prevent overreliance 
on AI and to reinforce student-generated output (Mir´on-M´erida & Gar-
cía-García, 2024; ˇSedlbauer et al., 2024). Collectively, the literature 
underscores the importance of pedagogical designs that are adaptive, 
ethically grounded, and capable of equipping students with the critical 
competencies necessary to navigate the complexities of AI-enhanced 
education.

instance, Walter (2024) provides a comprehensive framework for 
embedding AI tools in pedagogical contexts while maintaining academic 
rigor and student agency. Similarly, Mohamed (2024) emphasizes 
ethical dimensions in AI-supported assessment practices, a concern also 
echoed by Essel et al. (2024), who highlights the implications of 
AI-generated content for academic integrity. These works underscore 
the prominence of ethical, pedagogical, and technological integration as 
dominant themes, consistent with current theoretical debates on 
responsible AI use in education (Mhlanga, 2023; Tubella et al., 2024).
The concentration of publications in journals such as Education and 
Information Technologies and Education Sciences, each contributing 15 
articles, highlights their central role in shaping discourse on AI and 
critical thinking in higher education. These journals have consistently 
served as platforms for interdisciplinary dialogue, often publishing 
studies that bridge educational theory, technological innovation, and 
digital pedagogy. Their prominence suggests that researchers prioritize 
venues that support nuanced explorations of how AI tools influence 
cognitive development, ethical reasoning, and student engagement. 
Journals like Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, although 
newer and more specialized, also appear in the top tier, indicating 
growing scholarly interest in AI-specific educational applications. This 
trend aligns with broader shifts in academic publishing, where open- 
access, technology-focused journals are becoming preferred outlets for 
timely and impactful research on emerging educational challenges 
(Corrin et al., 2024, pp. 653–657).
Institutionally, the dominance of universities in the Middle East and 
Asia, such as King Saud University, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal 
University, and Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta, reflects increasing global 
engagement with AI-integrated pedagogies. These institutions demon-
strate productivity in terms of publication volume and reveal regional 
investment in digital transformation strategies within higher education 
systems. Their presence alongside institutions from Europe and Africa, 
including European University Cyprus and Kwame Nkrumah University 
of Science and Technology, points to a more inclusive research land-
scape. The diversity of institutional affiliations also signals a shift from 
traditional Western-centric knowledge production toward a more 
distributed and collaborative global research network. This finding may 
offer valuable opportunities for future cross-national studies, particu-
larly in understanding how contextual factors, such as infrastructure, 
policy, and cultural pedagogies, mediate the integration of critical 
thinking frameworks in AI-supported learning environments (Rios et al., 
2025).
The dominant themes identified across the five clusters reflect a 
maturing discourse on integrating artificial intelligence and critical 
thinking in higher education. The first cluster, which emphasizes 
pedagogical integration, underscores the increasing incorporation of 
AI—particularly generative AI—into curriculum development and 
instructional practices. However, the challenge lies in embedding AI into 
learning environments and aligning it with intellectual standards such as 
clarity, accuracy, and depth (Paul & Elder, 2019). The literature sug-
gests that while AI tools can support learning, they must be paired with 
pedagogical structures that ensure students are not merely consuming 
AI-generated outputs but actively questioning and analyzing them 
(Panit, 2024; Slade et al., 2025). Without such scaffolding, the devel-
opment of evaluative reasoning may be compromised despite techno-
logical innovation.
The second and third clusters, focusing on learner-centered attri-
butes and ethical considerations, reveal deeper cognitive and normative 
implications. Motivation, creativity, and psychological readiness 
emerge as mediating factors in the practical application of critical 
thinking, echoing the role of metacognitive and affective dimensions in 
Facione’s (2011) model. However, the ethical implications of AI 
use—mainly in academic writing and integrity—are still underexplored. 
The presence of keywords such as plagiarism, academic performance, 
and ethics signals growing concern over the authenticity of student work 
in AI-assisted contexts. This concern demands more than policy in-
terventions, requiring deliberate instructional design that cultivates 
ethical reasoning and decision-making in line with critical thinking 
standards (Ennis, 2018; Tathahira, 2020).
Clusters four and five suggest that institutional readiness and student 
perceptions are equally pivotal in shaping critical engagement with AI. 
The prominence of digital competence and AI literacy reflects a collec-
tive awareness that reflective dispositions must complement techno-
logical fluency. However, disparities in digital literacy and a lack of 
clarity about AI’s role in learning outcomes can hinder the cultivation of 
higher-order thinking skills (Walter, 2024). As universities attempt to 
innovate through AI integration, the literature highlights an urgent need 
for frameworks that simultaneously address technological, ethical, and 
cognitive dimensions, ensuring that AI serves as a tool for intellectual 
development, not a substitute for it (Chauncey & Mc Kenna, 2023; Nasir 
et al., 2024).
Recent trajectories in research on artificial intelligence and critical 
thinking highlight the need for pedagogical adaptability, ethical sensi-
tivity, and contextual relevance. Instead of assuming AI tools to be 
inherently beneficial, future investigations should interrogate the spe-
cific conditions under which technologies such as personalized learning 
platforms or intelligent tutoring systems contribute to, or potentially 
undermine, metacognitive development. The increasing reliance on 
automated feedback mechanisms presents complex dynamics in their 
implementation. While AI tools can provide tailored instructional sup-
port, they can inadvertently undermine students’ capacities for self- 
regulation, evaluate alternative perspectives, and make reasoned judg-
ments, core elements in Facione’s (2011) and Ennis’s (2018) frame-
works. Future inquiry should assess how these systems can be designed 
to enhance, not bypass, students’ reflective engagement.
Incorporating digital competence and AI literacy into curriculum 
design also calls for critically exploring how educators conceptualize 
and operationalize these competencies in various disciplines. There re-
mains a gap in understanding how faculty members navigate the 
alignment between AI-mediated instruction and intellectual standards 
such as clarity, logical consistency, and relevance (Paul & Elder, 2019). 
Research that investigates institutional readiness, instructional capacity, 
and curricular coherence will be key in bridging this gap—especially in 
engineering, health sciences, and language education, where critical 
thinking manifests through domain-specific reasoning. Such studies 
could provide actionable frameworks for embedding AI literacy in ways 
that sustain ethical awareness, disciplinary depth, and critical 
independence.
Finally, there is a growing need for research that addresses the equity 
and accessibility dimensions of AI integration. As digital tools become 
more embedded in higher education, students from resource- 
constrained institutions or underserved communities may face dispro-
portionate challenges in developing AI-related competencies. This 
highlights the urgency for culturally responsive and ethically sound 
pedagogical models that democratize access to AI-supported learning 
while safeguarding cognitive rigor and intellectual agency. Investigating 
how these models perform across diverse socio-educational settings can

help ensure that the future of AI in education is not only innovative but 
also inclusive.
4.2. Conceptualizations of critical thinking and expected student 
competencies in the AI era
The synthesized findings from the literature review reveal varied 
conceptualizations of critical thinking within AI-integrated learning 
environments in higher education. Some studies, such as those by Vieriu 
and Petrea (2025), Kharis et al. (2024), and Mir´on-M´erida and Gar-
cía-García (2024), do not explicitly define the concept of critical 
thinking they adopt, but instead highlight its importance in general 
terms. In contrast, several other studies refer to established theoretical 
frameworks—for example, Facione’s (2011) definition of critical 
thinking as a purposeful and self-regulated process of judgment, and 
Paul and Elder’s (2019) emphasis on reasoning guided by intellectual 
standards such as clarity, relevance, and consistency. Other studies have 
conducted specific contextual interpretations, framing the concept of 
critical thinking with students’ ability to analyze, interpret, and transmit 
AI-generated content (Alam et al., 2023; Liu & Tu, 2024; Michalon & 
Camacho-Zu˜niga, 2023). This perspective aligns with Ennis’s (2018)
characterization of critical thinking as a logical and reflective process 
directed toward deciding what to believe or do. However, the lack of 
explicit theoretical grounding in many studies underscores the urgency 
of pedagogical models that are theoretically sound and contextually 
relevant, especially in digitally mediated environments (Walter, 2024). 
In line with this need, Holmes and Miao (2023) emphasizes that inte-
grating generative AI in education must follow a human-centered 
approach that prioritizes human agency, critical discernment, and 
cognitive autonomy to ensure students remain active, reflective partic-
ipants in the learning process.
To operationalize this vision, students must acquire specific com-
petencies that enable them to engage with AI technologies while 
maintaining independent and critical thinking. These include AI and 
information literacy, evaluative reasoning, prompt engineering, and 
self-regulated learning strategies such as goal-setting and reflective 
monitoring (Essel et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2024). These 
skills enable students to engage with AI-generated content actively and 
questioningly, rather than passively consuming it. They are consistent 
with Facione’s (2011) cognitive taxonomy—particularly inference, 
evaluation, and self-regulation—and are further supported by Paul and 
Elder’s (2019) notion of intellectual discipline. Ethical awareness and 
academic integrity are crucial for fostering independent and critical 
engagement with AI tools (Chaparro-Banegas et al., 2024; Kharis et al., 
2024). Holmes and Miao (2023) underscores the importance of 
embedding these competencies into curricula, arguing that doing so 
protects learners from overreliance on AI systems and ensures that these 
technologies serve as cognitive support rather than cognitive sub-
stitutes. Several studies indicate that students must learn to question 
AI-generated outputs rather than accept them at face value, reflecting 
Tathahira (2020) call for students to develop discernment when inter-
preting digital content. As noted in multiple studies, the risk is that AI 
can diminish cognitive effort without pedagogical scaffolding and un-
dermine students’ ability to engage in sustained analysis (Gonsalves, 
2024; Sarwanti et al., 2024). Thus, developing students’ ability to 
evaluate and regulate their use of AI tools is central to maintaining the 
integrity of critical thinking in higher education.
4.3. Challenges in fostering critical thinking in AI-integrated higher 
education
The synthesized findings from the reviewed literature highlight a 
critical concern in AI-mediated education: students’ tendency to accept 
AI-generated content without adequate critical oversight. This pattern is 
antithetical to core definitions of critical thinking, which emphasize 
evaluative reasoning, reflective judgment, and intellectual autonomy 
(Ennis, 2018; Facione, 2011; Paul & Elder, 2019). Studies such as those 
by Zhou et al. (2024), Xu and Jumaat (2024), and Michalon and 
Camacho-Zu˜niga (2023) highlight that when students uncritically 
accept AI outputs, opportunities for practicing interpretation, inference, 
and evaluation are diminished. These are precisely the processes 
Facione (2011) identifies as essential for critical thinking. Furthermore, 
the unverified and sometimes erroneous nature of AI responses, such as 
hallucinated citations or misleading information (Alam et al., 2023; 
Essel et al., 2024), intensifies the need for higher-order reasoning and 
source validation, as emphasized by Tathahira (2020) and Lau (2011). 
The literature thus indicates a critical disconnect between the affor-
dances of AI and the actual pedagogical outcomes when critical thinking 
is not intentionally scaffolded. Without structured reflection activities 
and source triangulation strategies, AI use may promote convenience 
over comprehension, thus weakening students’ cognitive resilience. 
Holmes and Miao (2023) echoes these concerns by warning that 
generative AI systems risk diminishing learners’ capacity for discern-
ment and judgment without clear pedagogical validation. The guidance 
calls for systematic efforts to evaluate AI tools for their ethical and 
educational appropriateness, reinforcing the need for institutional 
oversight and learner agency.
In addition to cognitive challenges, emotional and contextual factors 
such as anxiety, digital skill gaps, and institutional readiness emerge as 
significant barriers to cultivating critical thinking. As Mahdi and Sahari 
(2024) noted, fear and uncertainty regarding AI tools can limit students’ 
willingness to engage critically, undermining Ennis’s (2018) notion of 
deliberate and rational judgment. Darwin et al. (2024) and Fakour and 
Imani (2025) add that AI’s inability to recognize nuance—such as irony, 
emotional tone, or socio-cultural context—limits its effectiveness in 
supporting deep thinking, especially in disciplines that rely on qualita-
tive or interpretive reasoning. Furthermore, institutional factors such as 
faculty training, inconsistent digital infrastructure, and the lack of 
ethical guidelines (Chaparro-Banegas et al., 2024; Tsopra et al., 2023) 
signal a systemic gap between AI adoption and pedagogical alignment. 
These constraints compromise the broader conditions needed to support 
the development of Paul and Elder’s (2019) intellectual standards, such 
as fairness, depth, and relevance.
While some recent studies highlight the potential of AI to support 
cognitive development—for instance, by enhancing argument con-
struction or promoting metacognitive awareness (Melisa et al., 2025; 
Raitskaya & Tikhonova, 2025)—these benefits are contingent on proper 
guidance and ethical implementation. This duality is echoed in Gon-
salves (2024) and Panit (2024), who caution that the cognitive effort 
required for deep analysis may be bypassed when AI is used without 
structured reflection. The present review reinforces these concerns by 
showing that in many cases, students are not sufficiently equipped to 
navigate the epistemic risks posed by AI (Zhai et al., 2024). This finding 
indicates an urgent need for AI-integrated curricula to embed systematic 
strategies that strengthen students’ analytical skepticism, source liter-
acy, and self-regulation. Holmes and Miao (2023) advocates for 
embedding AI-related competencies into curricula—technical skills and 
critical, ethical, and reflective capacities—to ensure that AI use en-
hances, rather than replaces, meaningful learning. By integrating these 
dimensions within institutional and instructional frameworks, higher 
education can more effectively foster the conditions under which critical 
thinking thrives, even in digitally mediated learning environments.
4.4. Instructional strategies for enhancing critical thinking in AI-supported 
learning environments
The synthesis findings reveal that instructional strategies that can 
foster critical thinking in AI-integrated higher education environments 
emphasize a combination of traditional pedagogy and AI-enhanced 
learning. This pedagogical hybridity reflects the theoretical alignment 
with Ennis’s (2018) view of critical thinking as a deliberative, reflective 
process and Paul and Elder’s (2019) conception of it as purposeful and 
A. Salido et al.

self-regulatory 
thinking. 
By 
integrating 
structured 
debates, 
problem-based learning, and real-world design tasks, educators 
encourage interpretation, inference, and evaluative reasoning—core 
skills outlined by Facione (2011). These findings support earlier 
research by Melisa et al. (2025) and Raitskaya and Tikhonova (2025), 
who note that AI tools can stimulate idea generation and metacognitive 
reflection when embedded within well-structured instructional envi-
ronments. However, without strategic pedagogical design, AI use may 
reinforce passive learning behaviors and reduce students’ opportunities 
for engaging in deep conceptual inquiry (Cookson, 2025). Holmes and 
Miao (2023) similarly cautions that generative AI has pedagogical po-
tential but must be embedded within intentional instructional design 
grounded in clear learning outcomes, ethical considerations, and 
human-centered educational values.
Another central dimension emerging from the literature is the role of 
explicit AI literacy training as a vehicle for critical thinking develop-
ment. Several studies advocate for embedding critical thinking instruc-
tion into digital literacy curricula, emphasizing guided prompt 
engineering, source verification, and the reflective use of generative AI 
tools (Michalon & Camacho-Zu˜niga, 2023; Qi et al., 2025). This finding 
aligns with Lau’s (2011) argument that critical thinking involves sys-
tematic logic and Sachdeva and Eggen’s (2021) emphasis on reflective 
reasoning. Institutional initiatives—such as faculty training, assessment 
reform, and ethical policy development—are likewise positioned as 
necessary scaffolds for supporting critical thinking. These insights par-
allel Deroncele-Acosta et al. (2025), who stress that critical thinking 
must be cultivated as a transversal competency across domains, partic-
ularly when addressing challenges posed by algorithmic outputs and 
digital misinformation. Holmes and Miao (2023) reinforces this view by 
calling for instructor capacity-building programs, policy alignment, and 
curriculum development frameworks that support the integration of 
AI-related competencies—including critical discernment, digital ethics, 
and epistemic responsibility—into all levels of education. Therefore, 
fostering critical thinking in AI-enhanced classrooms is not solely a 
cognitive task but also an institutional responsibility requiring align-
ment between curricular intent and instructional practice.
Finally, the reviewed studies underscore the importance of ethical 
awareness and affective engagement in supporting critical thinking 
under AI mediation. Positive student attitudes toward AI and reduced 
anxiety—especially in domains such as translation and language lear-
ning—are associated with deeper and more autonomous thinking 
(Mahdi & Sahari, 2024; Youssef et al., 2024). This finding echoes 
Facione’s (2011) argument that critical thinking encompasses cognitive 
skills and dispositions such as open-mindedness, truth-seeking, and 
confidence in reasoning. Additionally, strategies such as oral pre-
sentations, video tasks, and classroom-based assessments serve as 
counterbalances to AI dependency by reinforcing student-authored 
work and real-time reasoning (Mir´on-M´erida & García-García, 2024; 
ˇSedlbauer et al., 2024). Collectively, the evidence suggests that culti-
vating critical thinking in AI-supported education requires an instruc-
tional ecosystem that is ethically grounded, affectively responsive, and 
structurally designed to promote sustained reflection and intellectual 
independence.
5. Conclusions
This study aims to map the academic landscape of integrating AI and 
critical thinking in higher education and provide insights that can help 
shape curriculum design and teaching practices. The publication land-
scape between 2023 and 2025 reflects a growing scholarly consolidation 
around influential authors, prominent journals, and diverse institutional 
affiliations. Among the most impactful contributors are Walter Y., 
Mohamed A.M., and Essel H.B., each of whom has received over 100 
citations, indicating significant influence in shaping the discourse on 
artificial intelligence and critical thinking in higher education. Journals 
such as Education and Information Technologies and Education Sciences 
have emerged as leading publication venues, consistently disseminating 
research that bridges technological innovation with pedagogical devel-
opment. The geographic spread of contributing authors—from Asia and 
the Middle East to Africa and Europe—underscores the global relevance 
of this field and signals the emergence of new centers of academic 
productivity. This trend presents opportunities for cross-national 
collaboration and comparative studies that examine how contextual 
factors influence the integration of AI into higher education systems.
Thematic trends identified through keyword mapping reveal an 
evolving research agenda marked by five interconnected clusters: 
pedagogical innovation, psychological dimensions, academic ethics, 
systemic integration, and AI-related literacies. These clusters indicate a 
broadening conceptualization of critical thinking, where technological 
fluency must be accompanied by reflective judgment, ethical awareness, 
and domain-specific reasoning. Current research underscores the ne-
cessity for balanced AI integration—one that enhances, rather than re-
places, core cognitive processes. Future research directions point to the 
need for investigating adaptive curriculum design, disciplinary appli-
cations of AI, and inclusive pedagogical models that ensure equity, au-
tonomy, and intellectual rigor in AI-enhanced learning environments.
Based on a systematic literature review perspective, critical thinking 
is generally defined as a purposeful, evaluative, and self-regulated 
process that includes interpretation, analysis, inference, and reflection. 
Some studies adopt explicit theoretical frameworks—such as those 
proposed by Facione, Ennis, and Paul and Elder—while others empha-
size more applied perspectives, framing critical thinking as the ability to 
assess, verify, and use AI-generated content critically. Despite these 
differences, there is agreement that critical thinking in AI-mediated 
education demands intellectual autonomy, ethical awareness, and 
contextual sensitivity.
To cultivate these capacities, students need a combination of digital 
and AI literacy, metacognitive regulation, prompt engineering, argu-
ment construction, and ethical reasoning. However, the development of 
these competencies is often constrained by uncritical dependence on AI, 
limited system transparency, digital literacy gaps, and psychological 
barriers such as anxiety and uncertainty. Institutional limi-
tations—including insufficient faculty training, inadequate infrastruc-
ture, and weak ethical governance—further complicate efforts to foster 
critical thinking. In response, the literature emphasizes the need for 
pedagogical strategies that combine traditional and AI-enhanced 
methods, embed ethical and digital literacy, and promote reflective 
learning tasks. Future research is encouraged to examine inclusive 
instructional models, discipline-specific AI applications, and approaches 
that ensure critical thinking development remains equitable and intel-
lectually rigorous in increasingly automated academic environments.
This study acknowledges several limitations in its analysis. The 
findings are primarily derived from a synthesis of theoretical and bib-
liometric literature without direct empirical validation. As such, future 
research should prioritize qualitative and quantitative empirical in-
vestigations that assess the effectiveness of proposed instructional stra-
tegies in real-world learning environments. This study excluded 
conference proceedings, book chapters, and other non-peer-reviewed 
outputs regarding data coverage. While certain conference procee-
dings—particularly in computer science education—are subject to 
rigorous selection, many do not undergo standardized peer review, 
leading to variability in methodological rigor and limited long-term 
citability. This exclusion was intended to maintain the reliability and 
comparability of the dataset.
Additionally, the analysis focuses exclusively on publications 
explicitly referring to “critical thinking”. It does not encompass related 
constructs such as “computational thinking”, which, although concep-
tually distinct, can overlap in skills and competencies when applied in 
AI-enhanced educational contexts. This distinction is important for 
future research adopting a broader conceptual scope. Moreover, given 
the rapid pace of AI development and its varying applications across 
disciplines, there is a need for adaptable and context-sensitive

educational frameworks. These frameworks should be designed to 
optimize the integration of AI tools in higher education and ensure the 
sustained development of students’ critical thinking competencies 
across diverse cultural and institutional contexts.
