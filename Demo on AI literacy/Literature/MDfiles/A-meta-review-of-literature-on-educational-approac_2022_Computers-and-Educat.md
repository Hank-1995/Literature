Artificial intelligence (AI) teaching is becoming an increasingly popular topic among educators and researchers, 
but the research on AI curriculum for K-12 classrooms was under-explored. Currently, most studies examine the 
curriculum content of the United States and the European countries. However, there has been limited research on 
AI learning design and activities in the Asia-Pacific region. This meta-review examined 14 research papers on AI 
curriculum for K-12 classrooms that were taken in the Asia-Pacific region from 2018 to 2021 by identifying the 
content knowledge, tools, platforms, activities, theories and models, assessment methods, and learning outcomes 
of the selected studies. The results indicated that AI curricula can develop students’ AI knowledge and skills, 
learning attitudes, and interests. Furthermore, the research on AI education was conducted using both qualitative 
and quantitative methods which are useful for future educators and researchers to understand how they assess 
students’ AI learning performance. We also derive a set of implications for innovative pedagogical designs in 
terms of educational standards, curriculum designs, formal/informal education, student learning outcomes, 
teacher professional development and learning progressions to recommend how governments, researchers and 
educators could build a widely-accepted and age-appropriate AI curriculum for all K-12 learners.   
1. Introduction 
Artificial intelligence (AI) teaching in the twenty-first century has 
become increasingly important, as AI-driven technologies have affected 
many facets of human life rather than merely computer industries and 
research has proposed that K-12 students should learn AI (e.g., Goel, 
2017; Touretzky et al., 2019; Yang, 2019). The term “artificial intelli-
gence” refers to the use of a computer that can simulate intelligent 
human behaviour with technological innovations such as machine 
learning, natural language processing and neural networks (Hamet & 
Tremblay, 2017). Governments and universities across the globe have 
started to gather researchers and collaborators (i.e., policymakers, 
software developers, educators) to design curriculum guides, tools, 
pedagogies, content knowledge and assessment methods to bring K-12 
learners AI awareness and literacy (e.g., Ng et al., 2021a,b; Payne & 
Journell, 2019). They developed a variety of educational settings, 
including collaborative project-based learning, hands-on experience and 
online learning that focuses on how students strengthen their AI con-
cepts, attitudes and interests (e.g., Kelly, 2009; Marsh & Willis, 2003). In 
the past decade, AI was frequently and exclusively taught at the 
university level, and these courses are primarily geared toward students 
studying computer science and engineering (Ho & Scadding, 2019; 
Kandlhofer et al., 2016). However, with more age-appropriate AI-driven 
technologies, studies have started to explore AI education in K-12 set-
tings that focus on pedagogies, skills and tools/platforms (Burgsteiner 
et al., 2016; Papert & Solomon, 1971; Sensetime, 2018; Su & Yang, 
2022; Williams et al., 2019), as well as how to prepare educators to 
teach the next generation AI (Wilson, 2011). As such, after years of 
implementing AI teaching in K-12 settings, researchers and educators 
need to accumulate the teaching experience and practices to develop 
generally-recognized and age-appropriate curricula (Chiu, 2021; Chiu & 
Chai, 2020). 
Artificial Intelligence for the K-12 education field is very new. This 
review paper was based on a review of K-12 computer science education 
(e.g., Garneli et al., 2015; Menekse, 2015; Randolph et al., 2008). 
However, many rigorous decisions must be made for the successful 
implementation of the AI curriculum. With reference to the reviews, 
choosing between the different programming tools, activities, and 
instructional methods could be a challenging but important task (Gar-
neli et al., 2015). From the teachers’ perspectives, Menekse (2015)

proposed that due to a shortage of K-12 computer science teachers, 
training programs are necessary to facilitate computer science teachers 
to improve their abilities through teacher professional development. As 
such, to identify AI education research trends and improve its theories 
and practice, we proposed to examine a similar set of learning elements 
and considerations (e.g., pedagogies, tools/platforms) (Randolph et al., 
2008). Therefore, the aim of this article is to systematically review the 
studies regarding AI curriculum for K-12 classrooms in Asia to under-
stand programming tools, activities, instructional methods, teacher 
professional development, and the effectiveness of these AI curriculum 
programs in the past decade. 
On the whole, there is a pressing need to update educators through 
reviewing existing empirical studies to develop widely-accepted K-12 AI 
curricula, demystifying and clarifying the experiences of various 
implementation methods. Of this interest, this review aims to fulfil the 
needs in knowing the effective means to investigate the K-12 AI cur-
riculum for students in the Asia-Pacific regions and propose suggestions 
for further improvement of the quality of AI curricula. 
2. Background: K-12 AI education in Asia-Pacific Region 
Artificial intelligence teaching for K-12 schools has attracted 
increasing attention among institutions, researchers and educators 
globally. For instance, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial 
Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association 
(CSTA) have collaborated to start AI education for K-12 students in the 
United States in terms of knowledge representation, machine learning, 
and AI ethics education (Touretzky et al., 2019a,b). Moreover, the 
AI4K12.org project aimed to develop guidelines for AI education, which 
serves as a framework for policymakers and curriculum developers to 
adopt when developing the essential AI concepts, knowledge, and skills 
for each grade level. The guideline mentioned the five big ideas in AI 
including perception, representation & reasoning, learning, natural 
interaction, and societal impact of AI technologies (AI4K12.org, 2020). 
In addition, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has 
developed a suite of AI learning resources, including learning units, 
hands-on activities, and teacher education guides (MIT Media Lab, 
2020). Further, the UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies 
announced an education policy “AI in Education: Change at the Speed of 
Learning” which describes the advancements in recent technologies 
including data analytics personalized learning, and machine learning, 
and explores the promises of AI in education (UNESCO IITE, 2020). 
Despite the fact that these institutions have realized the value of AI 
education and continued to invest in it at various levels, the design of the 
AI K-12 curriculum is more complex and lacks standardisation, making 
it difficult to compare the outcomes among different institutions. 
Therefore, there is a necessity to explore the recent development in AI 
education for K-12 schools. 
Educators and researchers across countries are working rigorously to 
develop and explore effective curricula, pedagogy, learning materials, 
artefacts, systems and tools for their students (Burgsteiner et al., 2016; 
Chiu et al., 2021; Papert & Solomon, 1971; Sensetime, 2018; Touretzky, 
2020; Williams et al., 2019). In Asian countries, AI has become an 
emerging field from research, pedagogical practices, and policies. Due to 
their strength in the technology industry, countries such as Mainland 
China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Singapore have launched curric-
ular reforms to address the current movement in AI education. 
2.1. Mainland China 
In 2018, the Education Ministry has introduced AI into the K-12 
school curriculum with the first AI textbook supported by Sense Time to 
learn the basics of image recognition, sound recognition, text recogni-
tion and deep learning across 40 pilot schools (Sensetime, 2018; Yu 
et al., 2021). Three modes were commonly found in AI education in K-12 
settings: the flipped classroom paradigm, massive online open courses 
and web classes (Liu & Si, 2018). Students were encouraged to enhance 
their AI knowledge, skills, behavioural intention and attitudes via 
constructivism-based 
pedagogies 
comprising 
project-based 
and 
inquiry-based learning (Kim et al., 2021a; O˘guz Ünver & Arabacio˘Glu, 
2011). With the competitive advantage of huge data sets and pioneered 
China’s AI gianies, the country has rushed to pursue AI education with 
diversified emergent technologies such as biotechnology, drone and 
immersive technology which greatly increased the effectiveness of cur-
riculum implementation (Xiao et al., 2018). Appendix 1 illustrates ex-
amples of K-12 learning activities and their content knowledge in 
Mainland China. 
2.2. Hong Kong 
In 2017, the Education Bureau had announced an updated curricu-
lum guide for Technology Education from Primary 1 to Secondary 6 
(Curriculum Development Council, 2017). For K-12 levels, the renewed 
curricula comprise learning elements in technology education to 
enhance students’ abilities in computational thinking for the develop-
ment needs of society and technological developments (Curriculum 
Development Council, 2020). Furthermore, Hong Kong Education City 
(Ed City) announced the “Go AI Scheme” which aims to promote AI 
Education in Hong Kong through introducing self-paced learning plat-
forms and enhancing teachers’ and students’ AI knowledge and 
future-ready skills in the twenty-first Century (Ed City, 2021). More ex-
amples of learning designs on AI across different educational levels in 
Hong Kong are summarized in Appendix 2. 
2.3. Japan 
The Japanese government has decided to release a cultivating 
approach to K-12 pupils’ ability to use information technology and data 
literacy (Duan & Gong, 2019). Following that, the Ministry of Education, 
Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology issued a report and policy 
emphasizing how students might apply artificial intelligence technology 
to generate business value. In 2020, the Japanese national curriculum 
mandated computer science education offerings starting at primary 
schools (Kanemune et al., 2017). The goal of the guide is to prepare the 
K-12 students capable of understanding and using AI-enhanced tech-
nologies in their future to maintain the competitiveness of Japan as one 
of the leading countries in the AI-driven world. Also, it promotes the 
awareness and understanding of AI ethics among K-12 students (Eguchi 
et al., 2021). To align with the five Big Ideas in AI, a set of AI curricula 
and tools were recommended to visualize how AI works and provide 
hands-on experiences where students can be a creator of AI-enhanced 
artefacts and creations (Eguchi et al., 2021). 
2.4. Singapore 
In 2018, the Singapore government announced the “AI Singapore” 
project which aims to develop students’ AI capabilities. The project had 
brought together the research institutions including AI start-ups and 
companies to develop AI learning products to grow students’ AI 
knowledge and develop talents to power Singapore’s AI efforts. At the 
same time, two artificial intelligence research programs, “AI for Stu-
dents” and “AI for Kids” had also started. The former movement aims for 
facilitating a curriculum for all secondary school students via formal and 
informal learning experiences (e.g., AI Makerspace, Data Camp, and 
Society Discussion Forum) (AI Singapore, 2018a). Likewise, AI for Kids 
is aimed solely at elementary school pupils who should learn about 
fundamental AI concepts and use AI-driven tools and applications 
ethically (AI Singapore, 2018b). 
2.5. Korea 
In 2019, the Korean government announced the “National AI 
J. Su et al.

Strategy” to enhance the country’s AI competitiveness by 2030. The 
Ministry of Education had made plans to introduce AI to all high school 
students in 2021 and further extended AI education to kindergartens, 
primary and middle students by 2025 (Kim et al., 2021a). The high 
school students will learn two career elective subjects called “intro-
ductory AI” and “mathematics of AI” whereas the elementary and 
middle students will learn computer programming, basic principles of 
AI, use of AI and its ethical issues. AI teaching in elementary schools 
should focus on developing students’ AI literacy. The proposed AI cur-
riculum focuses on developing students’ AI literacy for elementary 
through three competencies including AI knowledge, AI skills, and AI 
attitude. First, AI knowledge includes definition and types of AI, 
problem-solving and search, reasoning, and data and machine learning 
and its application (Kim et al., 2021b). Second, AI skills include using AI 
tools, computational thinking & programming. Third, AI attitude in-
cludes the social impact and collaboration with AI. Further, the Korea 
Foundation for the Advancement of Science and Creativity (Kim, 2020) 
had completed research on exploring the AI curriculum at the K-12 level. 
A set of learning topics were proposed for students at different educa-
tional levels. Appendix 3 identifies AI topics (including rules and 
inference, machine learning, searching algorithms) and programming 
languages (e.g., Python, Scratch, App inventor). 
Three research gaps are identified. First, although previous studies 
have brought some AI curricula, tools or platforms into K-12 classrooms 
and demonstrated their potential effects (e.g., Ng, 2021; Wong et al., 
2019; Wong et al., 2020), little is known about what content knowledge 
should be taught and what pedagogies and tools/platforms should be 
used. A common approach is to address the instructional design and 
examine the content knowledge, programming tools, activities, peda-
gogies, and learning outcomes across prior studies (e.g., Garneli et al., 
2015; Menekse, 2015; Randolph et al., 2008). Based on this rationale, 
we apply a similar approach to investigate the successful learning ele-
ments to develop and refine our AI curricula in K-12 settings. Second, 
the majority of the studies on AI were conducted in Northern America 
and European regions such as the United States, Finland, Spain and 
Brazil (Touretzky et al., 2019; Van & Lin, 2020; Williams & Breazeal, 
2020; Van Brummelen, Heng, & Tabunshchyk, 2021; Tedre et al., 2020; 
Tedre, Toivonen, Kaihila, et al., 2021; Toivonen et al., 2020; García, 
Le´on, Gonz´alez, & Robles, 2019; von Wangenheim et al., 2020; von 
Wangenheim et al., 2021) while the topic in the Asia-Pacific Region has 
been rarely studied, as shown in Appendix 4. In recent years, countries 
such as China, Japan, Korea and Singapore have also launched national 
curricular reforms to address the current movement in AI teaching that 
is aligned with the global technological trend. It is meaningful to review 
how existing studies in the Asian-Pacific region could bring insights for 
AI teaching and further advance their AI teaching policies and curricula. 
Third, since AI is still an emerging field and it is an important field in 
computer science education, we referred to how other reviews examine 
their computer science-related curricula (e.g., media literacy, compu-
tational thinking) in K-12 education. 
3. Dimensions of education research 
To our knowledge, there is no theoretical framework and dimensions 
for understanding the AI curriculum at the K-12 level in the Asia-Pacific 
region at present. To obtain the overall picture of AI teaching and 
learning in K-12 education, this review looks beyond the traditional 
educational concerns of curriculum and pedagogy using the following 
six dimensions (Appendix 5). 
3.1. Educational standards 
Educational standards are the learning goals that students should 
know and be able to learn at different grade levels (Guskey, 2001). Since 
governments, local professional communities, and schools could pro-
pose their own AI curriculum policies, guides, and movements for 
students in their countries, this greatly affects how teachers design and 
implement their learning curriculum and activities. In other words, it is 
essential to identify the specific learning goals and standards to stipulate 
precisely what students need to learn as a result of their learning ex-
periences and outcomes. Since AI is a growing trend, it is necessary to 
list the country-level learning standards that are unpacked into homo-
geneous topics/elements for policymakers and educators to learn from 
neighbouring countries to update their curriculum guide and best teach 
their students in their regions. 
3.2. Curriculum design 
Curriculum design identifies the key components (learning goals, 
methods, materials/tools, and assessment) when educators organize 
their instructional units for their course during planning periods (Meo, 
2008; Yinger, 1980). Moreover, the design needs to be supported with 
explicit curriculum/educational principles and theories that serve the 
ground for constructing a meaningful experience for students (Taba, 
1962). In AI K-12 education, since different researchers derived their 
curriculum with diversified teaching beliefs, we need to explore the 
most common and widely used frameworks for learning goals, methods, 
materials/tools and assessments so that educators can advance their 
design timely based on the insights drawn from the selected studies. 
3.3. Formal and informal education 
Formal education is defined as the learning setting that is offered “in 
a structured and planned manner” which could be achieved via face-to- 
face or online learning forms. The setting is usually more planned and 
supervised by teachers (Sewell & Newman, 2014), whereas informal 
education does not necessarily fall into the realm of the normal curric-
ulum of schools and tends to be more organic and unplanned which 
could be difficult to identify its tangible ways within the organization 
(Eccles & Templeton, 2002; O’Neill, 2019) such as community-based 
clubs, camp programs (Xiao et al., 2018) and extracurricular programs 
(Ng, 2021). Prior studies construct AI learning activities in both formal 
and informal learning settings to offer opportunities for students to gain 
AI-related concepts and skills. 
3.4. Student learning outcomes 
Student learning outcomes measure the achieved results of what 
students have learned through examining student performance via 
measurable assessment methods such as quiz and evaluation surveys, 
and observable specific skills through presentations, portfolios and 
projects via well-defined rubrics (Allan, 1996; Diller & Phelps, 2008). 
Two constructs are commonly measured in AI education. First, cognitive 
constructs measure students’ understanding of AI skills and knowledge 
(e.g., Chiu, 2021; Ng, 2021), and other higher-order thinking skills such 
as collaboration, problem-solving and creativity (e.g., Chiu et al., 2021). 
Non-cognitive constructs are participants’ attitudes, dispositions and 
motivations towards AI learning (e.g., Kelly, 2009; Marsh & Willis, 
2003). The learning outcomes are identified among the selected studies 
for teachers to understand the impact of learning AI, and adopted 
different assessment methods to examine the students’ performance. 
3.5. Teacher professional development 
Teacher professional development is defined as activities that 
develop the skills, knowledge, expertise and other characteristics of a 
teacher (OECD, 2009). Many teachers showed their worries about AI 
teaching and have reported a lack of confidence in their understanding 
because they often lack access to relevant technological pedagogical 
content knowledge. It is important to examine how existing studies 
support teachers to update their knowledge to facilitate AI teaching. 
J. Su et al.

3.6. Learning progression 
Learning progression is a continuum that maps key stages in the 
development of a learning domain (AI learning in our review) from 
beginnings through to complex interpretations and applications (ACER, 
2022; Wilson, 2009). When teachers need to create a learning progres-
sion for their students, it requires the considerations of the necessary 
skills and knowledge that students are expected to have across multiple 
developmental stages, ages and grade levels and some researchers would 
refer to this as grade-level expectations or standards (CCII, 2009; Wil-
son, 2009). Our selected studies found that an age-appropriate curric-
ulum, tools, content and pedagogies are important to scaffold student 
understanding on acquisition AI knowledge and skills which should map 
their developmental stages and learning needs. 
4. Methods 
The review follows the methodological framework developed by 
Arksey and O’Malley (2005) and further revised by Levac et al. (2010). 
The five stages of this review include (1) identifying the research 
questions, (2) identifying relevant studies, (3) selection and exclusion, 
(4) data charting and collation, and (5) summarizing and reporting the 
findings. 
4.1. Identifying the research objectives and questions 
The review aims to evaluate, synthesize and present literature on AI 
in educational domains, particularly looking at AI curriculum for K-12 
classrooms (kindergarten to 12th grade) in Asia. In addition, the study 
suggests a possible process for future research to establish a strong 
theoretical basis and specify possible challenges or barriers that hinder 
the effective implementation of AI curriculum design. This review has 
two objectives:  
1. To evaluate the existing research designs, curriculum designs, and 
research findings ascribed to the existing literature of research on K- 
12 AI curriculum in the Asia-Pacific Region; and 
2. To explore future research directions in the areas of advancing cur-
riculum designs, and evaluation for K-12 AI curriculum in the Asia- 
Pacific region. 
Three research questions (RQs) that guided this study are as follows: 
RQ1:.
What research designs have been used in examining the K-12 AI 
curriculum in the Asia-Pacific region? 
RQ2:.
What elements should be included in the AI K-12 education (in 
terms of curriculum design, theory, system, and tools) in the Asia-Pacific 
region? 
RQ3:.
What are the learning outcomes of implementing an AI curric-
ulum in K-12 settings? 
4.2. Identifying relevant studies 
The review first identifies the keywords of our research. The elec-
tronic databases used for the literature search included Education Re-
sources Information Center (ERIC), IEEE, Education Research Complete, 
Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Initially, we entered search 
terms such as “artificial intelligence” and “education”, but to narrow the 
results, we used a similar approach from Toh, Causo, Tzuo, Chen, and 
Yeo (2016). The search string used for AI curriculum review was: “AI” 
OR “Artificial Intelligence” OR “Deep learning” OR “Machine Learning” 
OR “Neural network*” OR “chatbot*” OR “Natural language process*” 
OR “Robotic*” AND “education” OR “primary school*” OR “preschool*” 
OR “kindergarten*” OR “pre-k*” OR “secondary school*” OR “high 
school*” OR “K-12” AND “curricula*” OR “learning” OR “curriculum 
design”. Different types of literature are included in this review, such as 
research articles and conference papers. This process yielded 14 articles 
including 9 research articles and 5 conference papers. To facilitate the 
database search, this study identifies all peer-reviewed academic articles 
published from 2018 to 2021 since the first article is found in 2018 (i.e., 
Xiao et al., 2018). 
4.3. Study selection and exclusion 
As shown in Fig. 1, by using the keyword search descriptors, 5102 
articles were identified, 2602 from Web of Science, 46 from ERIC, 536 
from IEEE, 486 from Education Research Complete, 1329 from Scopus, 
and 103 from google scholar (n = 5102). The following articles were 
removed from the study: (1) articles that were not related to research 
topic and abstract (n = 5012); (2) duplicate studies (n = 21); (3) articles 
that participants or settings not 3–18 years old were excluded (n = 17); 
(4) articles that focus/topic not AI were excluded (n = 12); (5) papers 
not related to curriculum/learning program/learning activities were 
removed (n = 11); and (5) As shown in appendix 4, articles that focus/ 
topic not in Asia were also excluded (n = 15). Our inclusion criteria 
required all articles to be in English. Fourteen articles that are focused 
on the AI curriculum at the K-12 level in the Asia-Pacific Region were 
thoroughly reviewed (2018, 1 article; 2019, 3 articles; 2020, 4 articles, 
and 2021, 6 articles). 
4.4. Data charting and collation 
Summaries were developed based on articles related to the author, 
year, location of study, article name, journal, and impact factor of the 
included studies. Summaries of included studies were presented in 
Appendix 6. 
4.5. Summarizing and reporting the findings 
The final stage of Arksey and O’Malley’s (2005) scoping review 
framework summarizes and reports the important findings. We critically 
analyzed different aspects, including research design, data collection 
procedures, pedagogy, educational theories, and tools/systems from the 
selected and further concluded with important findings. 
5. Findings 
Although AI is an essential topic in K-12 education, it is rarely 
explored in the Asia-Pacific region. Only 14 studies were identified in 
the region where 9 studies were conducted in Hong Kong and the rest 
were conducted in other regions/countries including Korea (2 articles), 
Mainland China (2 articles), India (1 article), as shown in Appendix 7. 
We assume that this number of research articles (n = 14) is sufficient to 
provide an exploratory view of K-12 AI education, as represented by 
publications from various regions/countries in Asia. 
5.1. Research designs 
A total of 14 study design aspects have been identified. Interviews (7 
articles) are the most commonly-used data collection methods, followed 
by document analysis and questionnaires (2 articles). Table 1 outlines 
two data collection strategies typically employed in these studies (i.e., 
interviews and document analysis). As indicated in Table 2, the majority 
of research used a qualitative approach, followed by a mixed-methods 
approach. In six papers, qualitative research approaches for data 
collection using various methodologies are discussed (e.g., interviews, 
teaching documents, meeting minutes, and case studies). In addition, 
two studies used a combination of pre-and post-questionnaires, semi- 
structured interviews, motivational surveys, lesson observation, indi-
vidual interviews, teaching materials, meeting minutes, and school- 
based curricular documents to collect data.

We also discovered an AI curriculum study conducted in Hong Kong 
regarding designing an AI curriculum for middle schools. Individual 
interviews, teaching documents, meeting minutes, and school-based 
curriculum documents were all utilized by Chiu (2020). The findings 
revealed that six essential elements (e.g., definition, rationale, effective 
content, adaptability, learning, and communication process) should be 
considered when developing an AI curriculum. It also demonstrates that 
there are four different curriculum design approaches. The data was 
gathered and evaluated using a qualitative research design. Overall, few 
studies were discovered to fulfil the qualitative research features (Chiu, 
2021; Chiu & Chai, 2020; Kim et al., 2021a; Wong et al., 2019). 
5.2. Curriculum design, theory, system and tools 
5.2.1. Curriculum design 
To examine the key success factors in the AI curriculum design of K- 
12 education in the Asia-Pacific region, we looked at a set of learning 
elements in terms of curriculum design, theory, systems and tools that 
were employed in the curriculum to assist student learning. In terms of 
instructional design, the majority of the research was highly note-
worthy. In the Asia-Pacific area, the majority of AI for K-12 curriculum 
studies were very successful. Eight of the fourteen studies looking into AI 
curricula in the Asia-Pacific region were done in Hong Kong, with the 
rest in mainland China (2 studies) and Korea (3 studies). Some re-
searchers were focused on the design approach of the AI curriculum 
(Chiu, 2020; Chiu & Chai, 2020). A handful of studies have only looked 
at AI curricula in secondary schools (Chiu, 2020, 2021; Chiu et al., 2021; 
Xiao et al., 2018; Ng, 2021; Wong et al., 2020). The instructional design 
employed in these experiments is summarized in Table 3. 
5.2.2. Theory 
Most research was quite impactful in terms of the theory or model 
applied. To begin with, Chiu (2021) created a holistic model for 
designing an AI curriculum at the K-12 level, as well as a summary of the 
entire AI teaching and learning approach. The goal of bringing AI into 
K-12 education is to encourage more students to study AI and consider

future vocations at a young age (Delaine et al., 2016). Second, one study 
used the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) 
Framework (e.g., content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and 
pedagogical content knowledge) as a pedagogy design framework (e.g., 
content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and pedagogical content 
knowledge) (Kim et al., 2021a). The goal of Technological Pedagogical 
Content Knowledge (TPACK) is to teach students using technology. Each 
element for teaching AI at the K-12 level was conceptualized by TPACK. 
Finally, some researchers have used Self-determination Theory and 
curriculum planning methodologies to explain study issues and findings 
(Chiu & Chai, 2020). The role of autonomy and ability support for 
generating intrinsic motives was emphasized in self-determination the-
ory (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Table 4 contains more information about the 
included studies’ theory, framework, and model. 
5.2.3. Technological tools and systems 
It is important to determine the tools or systems in the studies. As 
indicated in Table 5, six studies have employed CUHKi Car, i STREAM, 
Educational Broadcasting System (EBS), Scratch, Cozmo, Edomo, and 
Anki Cozmo as platforms for facilitating student learning. Scratch is the 
most often used tool for AI projects (Chiu, 2021; Wong et al., 2019). A 
few education academics have created project activities aimed at 
improving children’s interaction, learning, and cognitive abilities (Chiu

et al., 2021; Ng, 2021; Wong et al., 2020). Furthermore, Wong (2020) 
discovered that elementary school students are interested in the projects 
(e.g., Cozmo), which is consistent with previous research (Kumar, 2001; 
Mc Govern, Tidwell, & Rushing, 2021). To begin with, a hardware toolkit 
(e.g., CUHKi Car) contributed by the Chinese University of Hong Kong 
research team comprises face-tracking and line following (Chiu et al., 
2021). Furthermore, the i STREAM AI education system includes a va-
riety of emerging technologies such as robotics, Internet of Things, 
virtual reality, intelligent manufacturing, research and innovation via 
creative and practical camp programs at various levels (Han, 2018). 
Finally, Kim et al. (2021) discovered multiple EBS online AI lectures at 
K-12 settings based on the CSTA framework (Computer Science Teachers 
Association, 2017). These tools and platforms provide developmentally 
appropriate resources to scaffold students’ AI understanding which is 
consistent with previous CSTA frameworks that describe how computer 
science knowledge should be scaffold. The framework includes intro-
ducing basic computer science ideas starting in elementary school, 
presenting computer science in secondary school for computer science, 
math, or science credit, encouraging secondary schools to offer addi-
tional related courses so interested students can learn more and prepare 
for the workforce or college, and increasing access to rigorous computer 
science for all students, especially underrepresented groups (Computer 
Science Teachers Association, 2017). 
5.3. Effects 
Studies regarding the AI curriculum have showed a positive influ-
ence on students’ learning outcomes with various AI concepts such as AI, 
machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning (Chiu, 2020, 
2021; Chiu & Chai, 2020; Chiu et al., 2021; Han et al., 2018; Kim et al., 
2021a, 2021b; Wong et al., 2019, 2020). 
Overall, the AI curriculum from the selected studies demonstrated 
success in improving students’ interest in AI courses, developing AI- 
related skills, and strengthening their learning attitude. For example, 
Wong et al. (2019) and Ng (2020) pointed out that their AI learning 
piqued children’s interest in learning various AI-related concepts (e.g., 
computer vision) and using AI applications effectively in their daily life 
to facilitate their learning in informal settings including information 
sessions, workshops and online platforms. Another study conducted by 
Kim et al. (2021b) proposed an AI curriculum for 60 elementary school 
students and showed that the AI curriculum could effectively improve 
students’ AI knowledge competency, proficiency in using AI tools, 
computational thinking and programming, and strengthen their 
learning attitude. Vazhayil et al. (2019) reported that teachers felt more 
confident, motivated and enthusiastic about incorporating AI lessons 
into their classrooms that they are more familiar with AI technologies (e. 
g., facial recognition, machine learning). 
Chai et al. (2021) used the Positive Technological Development 
Framework (PTD) as a questionnaire tool to assess student learning on 
AI issues (i.e., behavioural intention). The findings showed that 
self-efficacy in learning AI, AI preparedness, and perceived usage of AI 
for societal good influenced 682 elementary school children in Beijing. 
According to the researchers, the AI curriculum should pay greater 
attention to students’ attitudes, behavioural intentions, and perceived 
behavioural control. The Positive Technological Growth Framework 
(PTD) strives to foster positive development through the use of tech-
nology (Bers et al., 2009, p. 22). Researchers found that motivational 
aspects and strategies (such as attention, relevance, confidence, and 
satisfaction) of AI learning benefited primary school students in Beijing 
(Lin et al., 2021). 
Learning motivation is an important factor in explaining how people 
invest in learning activities and their willingness to participate in a 
learning environment (Chai et al., 2020; Jong et al., 2010; Law et al., 
2019; Riasati, 2012; Shang et al., 2006). Learning motivation includes 
both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. According to Ryan and Deci 
(2000), intrinsic motivation is a component of learning processes. For 
example, if students think that AI courses or activities are interesting, 
they will be intrinsically motivated and feel happy and satisfied with the 
learning process. Extrinsic motivation is associated with a person’s 
desire to succeed and achieve specific goals (Ryan & Deci, 2000). For 
example, teachers can give students a brief overview of the AI industry,

and work with AI companies to arrange visits to help students under-
stand the evolution of AI careers. Researchers discovered that student 
motivation influences students’ willingness to learn AI (Chai et al., 2021; 
Lin et al., 2021). As a result, increasing students’ motivation will in-
crease students’ willingness to learn AI courses. Therefore, AI course 
content and AI activity design are critically important for stimulating 
learning. As such, the course design should be combined with daily life 
to make students feel interesting and practical. 
6. Discussion 
6.1. Empirical findings 
This paper contributes to the research about AI teaching in K-12 
settings in the Asian-Pacific regions. It advances knowledge on the 
emerging field of AI education (Ng et al., 2021a,b) by adopting a 
six-dimension quality education research to identify prominent learning 
elements to advance the AI curricula in terms of theoretical frame-
works/theories, pedagogies, content and tools/platforms (Guskey, 
2001; Meo, 2008). Our discussion provides a good starting point for 
scholars to further explore how to investigate the effective means for AI 
curricula, as well as the research and educational implications for 
different stakeholders in the educational fields. While this article pro-
vides a survey of the learning elements identified in the selected article, 
we encourage future researchers to conduct rigorous research to inves-
tigate the successful factors on developing AI curricula and the best 
pedagogical practices to address them using diversified research 
methods. 
Furthermore, this article contributes to the AI teaching research 
across the countries by providing insights for educators and policy-
makers to compare their curricula with their neighbouring countries to 
refine their AI teaching (Bostrom & Yudkowsky, 2014; Wallach & Allen, 
2008). In this way, governments would understand their nations’ need 
to timely improve their curriculum reform, and offer age-appropriate 
and widely-accepted instructions for the students. It was identified 
that only two of the 14 papers focus on AI curricula in primary school 
settings (Ho & Scadding, 2019; Wong et al., 2019). First, Wong et al. 
(2019) investigated an AI curriculum for primary students to participate 
in hands-on projects in Scratch and Cozmo to explore the basic ideas of 
computer vision and AI. Another study conducted by Ho and Scadding 
(2019) demonstrated how to visualize the complex AI concepts (i.e., 
facial recognition, machine learning) to elementary school students 
using simple computer algorithms and simulations that mimic human 
behaviours. Researchers could gain pedagogical experience from col-
leagues from other regions/countries. 
Workshops, lessons and hands-on units have been commonly utilized 
to inform the design of learning activities with the use of AI tools/ 
platforms in terms of AI activities (e.g., Ng, 2021). Some researchers 
have created AI tools/systems (e.g., CUHKi Car, Edmodo, Anki Cozmo) 
to facilitate students to enhance their interaction, knowledge acquisi-
tion, and critical thinking skills (Chiu et al., 2021; Wong et al., 2020). 
Various learning platforms including i STREAM, educational broad-
casting system, Scratch, and Cozmo are utilized to facilitate course or-
ganizations and offer programming experience in K-12 AI instruction (e. 
g., Xiao et al., 2018). These studies investigated a set of learning plat-
forms and tools that have been utilized to create AI curricula for K-12 
pupils. Future studies should examine the strengths and weaknesses of 
these AI platforms/tools. A set of implications are discussed for educa-
tors and researchers as follows using the proposed six-dimensional 
quality education model. 
6.2. Implications 
6.2.1. Pedagogical implications 
6.2.1.1. Education standards. Many governments, local professional 
communities and schools proposed their curriculum policies and guides 
for all students to learn AI in their countries (Guskey, 2001). A common 
education standard should be set to define what types of AI knowledge 
and skills should possess at different developmental stages in K-12 set-
tings. Such standards are important to serve as a basis of educational 
reform across the nation since policymakers and educators need to 
identify the desired learning outcomes of AI education such as 
enhancing student competitiveness, equipping students with futuristic 
skills, fulfilling job demands in the AI industry, and raising children to 
become responsible citizens (Ng et al., 2021a,b). When developing and 
implementing the nation-wide standards, policymakers and school 
leaders play an important role in making the decisions on what learning 
elements should be included in the curriculum guide. With the standard, 
educators could design learning activities that satisfy these targets and 
the learning outcomes could be diverse from different standards. Also, 
universities, professional organizations and companies could follow the 
guidelines and standards to research and develop appropriate materials, 
tools and platforms for students via the standard-based AI education. 
6.2.1.2. Curriculum design. A number of studies have identified several 
successful educational theories and models utilized in AI curriculum 
design (Chiu, 2021; Chiu & Chai, 2020; Kim et al., 2021a). For example, 
Chiu (2021) created a holistic model that consists of AI knowledge, 
processes, the influence/impact of using AI, whether AI is relevant to 
students, teacher-student communication, and technological adapt-
ability for secondary students in Hong Kong. Another study conducted 
by Kim et al. (2021a) applied the Technological Pedagogical Content 
Knowledge (TPACK) framework to improve AI teaching and learning in 
terms of content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and pedagogical 
content knowledge. Third, a case study demonstrates that curriculum 
planning uses applied self-determination theory and methodologies 
regarding the learning content, product, process and praxis (Chiu & 
Chai, 2020). As a result, educators should consider these elements to 
design AI curriculum design using appropriate theoretical frameworks. 
After that, problem/project/case-based learning that was most 
commonly found in our review. According to Duffy and Cunningham 
(1996, p. 190), there are five strategies for using problems in instruction, 
such as “the problem as a guide, the problem as an integrator or test, the 
problem as an example, the problem as a vehicle for process, and the 
problem as a stimulus for authentic activity”. Problem-based learning 
(PBL) is a constructivist pedagogy and student-centred method for 
learning (Savery, 2015; Ten Cate, 2013). Case-based learning is known 
as “case study teaching and case method learning” (Thistlethwaite et al., 
2012, p. 421). 
6.2.1.3. Formal and informal education. Both formal and informal edu-
cation can be combined to promote AI education. Formal education 
which is led by teachers in schools and universities (Steinbauer et al., 
2021) tends to focus on AI at the K-12 level in terms of curricula, 
guidelines, or standards. A variety of standards and guidelines identified 
in formal education in different regions can provide effective references 
for future practice, such as Five Big Ideas in AI (perception, represen-
tation and reasoning, learning, natural interaction, and societal impact) 
(Touretzky et al., 2019) and the AI4Kids initiative that aims to cultivate 
basic knowledge in AI and meanwhile includes certificated teacher ed-
ucation (Steinbauer et al., 2021). However, due to a big shift from 
formal to informal education brought by the technology, learning and 
technology will be more democratized. Therefore, schools and univer-

develop high-quality AI courses. Users registered in the informal edu-
cation institutions can obtain a certificate in AI regardless of gender, age 
and nationalities (Steinbauer et al., 2021). Given the different roles and 
impacts of informal and formal education, this review provides valuable 
references for schools to design and implement AI education programs 
and seek relevant cooperation in developing AI education. 
6.2.1.4. Student learning outcomes. To measure students’ learning out-
comes, a variety of assessment methods including pre-and post-ques-
tionnaires, individual/semi-structured interviews, motivational surveys, 
lesson observation, teaching documents, meeting minutes, and school- 
based curriculum documents and student artefacts (e.g., work, pro-
jects) were analyzed. However, since AI learning assessment is at its 
beginning stage, these tools are not widely-used nor rigorously vali-
dated. In the future, rubrics and assessment methods need to be devel-
oped to assess students’ learning motivation, preparation, and 
behaviour intentions (e.g., self-efficacy in learning, AI literacy, and 
perceived relevance of AI). Also, other formative assessment methods 
such as project analysis, student presentation, drawing and AI data 
analytical tools for students to self-assess themselves could be adopted in 
the future. Formative assessment could “provide feedback and correc-
tives at each stage in the teaching and learning process” (Bloom, 1969, 
p. 48). With advanced AI-driven technologies, self-assessments offer 
students automatic and precise examinations to monitor their individ-
ualized learning progress and evaluate their thinking and behaviour 
while learning. This could raise student meta-cognitive skills to identify 
individual learning strategies to obtain knowledge and skills in the 
future (Mc Millan & Hearn, 2008). 
6.2.1.5. Teacher professional development. During the fourth industrial 
revolution, our educators needed to update their knowledge in emerging 
technologies such as AI, and skills for adapting to new modes of teaching 
(e.g., using AI technologies in education). It is critical to enhance the 
digital literacy of educators to facilitate students becoming future-ready. 
Aligned with prior studies, teacher professional development for AI 
education requires excellent rigorous lesson studies, action research, 
performance assessments and portfolio examinations that could link 
their learning to their classroom practices (Darling-Hammond, 1999). 
Another study conducted by Wilson (2011) pointed out that gathering 
teachers to assess students’ work, such as drawings, explanations, 
writings, and videotaped classroom conversations for formative pur-
poses is one of the most promising techniques for quality teacher pro-
fessional development. With these strategies, teachers could adjust their 
instructional approaches to timely review and refine their strategies to 
teach AI, thus developing student 21st-century competencies. 
6.2.1.6. Learning progression. Several challenges for AI learning and 
teaching for K-12 students were identified due to discontinued learning 
progression which can be reflected through multiple developmental 
stages, ages and grade levels. First, recent research studies have showed 
that most students have little programming experience (Kahn et al., 
2018), those from low and medium socioeconomic schools (Druga et al., 
2019), who are particularly struggling for grasping AI concepts. Because 
of resource differences in K-12 Computer Science education in Asia, not 
all students obtain adequate programming knowledge and experience. 
As such, educators need to understand the learning needs of students to 
scaffold their understanding of AI knowledge (Ng, 2021). Moreover, low 
floor high ceiling tasks (e.g., blockly programming, simulation) should 
be incorporated and developed to visualize and lead students towards 
richer AI discussion (Ke et al., 2020). 
Second, we recognized that there is an absence of ready-made and 
pre-packaged teaching materials or resources for teachers who must 
prepare their learning materials mainly by themselves. Scholars in the 
field of AI education at universities can collaborate with K-12 schools to 
timely offer teachers professional programs, and develop teaching 
materials (MIT Media Lab, 2020). Similarly, widely-recognized quali-
tative and quantitative assessment methods should be developed to 
examine student AI understanding. Third, in STEM and Computational 
Thinking education, researchers often identify gender bias in students’ 
learning attitudes and abilities (Rybinski & Kopciuszewska, 2021). The 
situation could be similar in AI education; as such, gender-responsive (or 
even culturally-responsive) practices are required to adopt diverse 
teaching styles and assessment methods to address students’ learning 
needs and reduce gender bias and expectations. Finally, we summarized 
a set of curricula in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Korea, which could 
be found online to offer recommendations for educators to consider the 
age-appropriate content knowledge for different developmental stages 
and grade levels (see Appendix 1-3). 
6.2.2. Research implications 
This paper highlights the AI K-12 curriculum in Asia, and it can be 
used by educators and researchers as a resource. It also summarizes the 
various AI courses (concepts, frameworks) and teaching activities in 
various Asian countries and regions. These contents can assist AI edu-
cators or researchers in finding and developing the most appropriate 
courses for K-12 students. 
6.3. Recommendations 
6.3.1. Educators 
This review study provides useful recommendations for K-12 AI 
curriculum development. To begin with, teachers who teach AI subjects 
are advised to receive comprehensive training (e.g., workshops, semi-
nars), collaborate closely with AI education experts, and meanwhile 
develop an assessment for evaluating the effectiveness of the AI K-12 
curriculum. Second, more teaching resources, including both hardware 
and software components, should be developed to consolidate students’ 
knowledge such as using online platforms via self-paced learning, hands- 
on experience of using AI applications to solve authentic problems, and 
visualizing AI theories via simulation and other AI technologies. Third, 
teachers should design the AI learning experience with engaging peda-
gogies such as gamification and game-based learning approaches to 
enhance students’ interest and motivation in learning AI (Ho & Chu, 
2019). Fourth, diversified AI activities should be applied to enrich stu-
dents’ learning experience, such as AI applications creation, project 
implementation, case studies to investigate AI-related societal impact 
(Touretzky et al., 2019), digital story writing and knowledge competi-
tions for students at the K-12 level. These activities help students un-
derstand AI, such as how AI works, sources of bias in AI, and societal 
impacts of AI systems. 
Additionally, this study suggested different AI tools and resources for 
K-12 students and teachers as a reference, such as machine learning 
tools/platforms such as Google’s Quickdraw (https://quickdraw.with 
google.com/), Machine learning for kids (https://machinelearni 
ngforkids.co.uk/), Tensorflow playground (https://playground.tensor 
flow.org/), and AI education platforms for games and robotics design 
using blockly-based programming (https://www.ai4children.org/) and 
AI model trainers (http://cognimates.me/) (Touretzky et al., 2019). 
Fifth, many AI K-12 programs are extremely successful in developed 
countries, but may not be successful in developing Asian countries. 
Some researchers found that cultural responsive factors will affect cur-
riculum development in Asia developing countries (Eguchi et al., 2021; 
Gorman & Dorner, 2006). We suggest that it is more appropriate to 
develop AI K-12 courses that suit the students in their own country, on 
top of merely following other successful examples. 
6.3.2. Researchers 
This review reveals a list of scarce but successful research on AI 
curriculum that promotes student learning across Asian regions (e.g., 
Van Brummelen & Lin, 2020; Williams & Breazeal, 2020; Van Brum-
melen et al., 2021). Since AI educational research in K-12 emerged these 
J. Su et al.

years, it is understood that most of our studies are exploratory in nature. 
However, this study gives important recommendations and guidelines 
for future AI researchers and educators to design meaningful learning 
design, pedagogy, theory, system, and tools to foster students’ AI un-
derstandings and mindsets. Future studies are needed to apply rigorous 
quantitative methods (e.g., correlational, quasi-experimental, factor 
analysis) and qualitative methods (e.g., content and thematic analysis, 
action research, dialogue analysis) to offer a fuller picture of AI learning. 
It is consistent with our findings that some most recent studies such as 
Chiu et al. (2022) provided a good sample size with 335 students using 
paired t-tests and ANCOVAS, and thematic analysis to analyze students’ 
performance. Another study conducted by Chai et al. (2021) measured 
students’ self-efficacy in learning AI, AI readiness, perceptions of using 
AI for good, AI literacy and behavioral intention among 682 students. Ng 
et al. (2022) explored the use of digital story writing as a pedagogy to 
understand how primary students scaffold their AI understandings from 
low to high cognition levels. With more and more literature evidence, 
future researchers and educators can devote time to developing more 
meaningful AI learning activities for K-12 curricula and ensure a quality 
curriculum implementation. 
7. Conclusion and limitations 
This meta-review aids in the mapping of existing AI curriculum 
research design, AI tools, AI activities, educational models or theories, 
and research outcomes attributed to the existing literature on K-12 AI 
curriculum research. Interviews (7 articles) are the most commonly- 
used data collection methods, followed by document analysis and 
questionnaires (2 articles). Most research was quite impactful in terms of 
the theory or model applied, such as holistic model (Chiu, 2021), 
Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) Framework 
(Kim et al., 2021a), Self-determination (Chiu & Chai, 2020). Most 
studies regarding the AI curriculum showed a positive influence on 
students’ learning outcomes with various AI concepts such as AI, ma-
chine learning, neural networks, and deep learning and improve stu-
dents’ interest in AI courses, develop AI-related skills, and strengthen 
their learning attitude. The value of the study is that despite some dif-
ferences in various educational contexts, the challenges in developing 
and promoting AI curriculum in Asian-pacific regions were identical, 
which include pedagogical challenges, lack of valid and reliable 
assessment, design, and professional development support. All these 
results will inform educators, researchers, as well as curriculum de-
velopers of the gaps in designing and developing AI curricula for K-12 
schools so that we will well consider these factors that impact AI 
education while developing specific AI curricula. This paper contributes 
to curriculum development (aspect and theory). The findings, on the 
other hand, can help direct future research in AI tools or platforms, 
pedagogical approaches, and assessment for K-12 AI curricula, and 
meanwhile provide a useful guide for the design, implementation, and 
evaluation of AI curricula at the K-12 level. 
This review accumulated the successful experience from the 14 
selected studies to provide theoretical and empirical support to advance 
this new field of AI education. Researchers, educators and other stake-
holders would gather collaborative intelligence and further refine their 
AI curricula to develop students’ AI knowledge and skills, learning at-
titudes and interests. Moreover, more rigorous evaluation methods using 
qualitative and quantitative approaches are necessary for future edu-
cators and researchers to understand how they examine students’ AI 
learning performance. A set of implications and recommendations for 
pedagogical designs in terms of educational standards, curriculum de-
signs, formal/informal education, student learning outcomes, teacher 
professional development and learning progressions were set up. Addi-
tionally, behaviourist theory, cognitive theory, and constructivist theory 
will be instrumental in addressing AI education. In particular, since 
learning is recognized to be a social process, involves cognitive thinking, 
and renders behavioural changes, constructive learning theories and 
models such as project-based learning, problem-based learning, and 
inquiry-based learning will better support AI education. 
One of the limitations of our study relates to the small amount of 
literature on AI curriculum for K-12 classrooms in the Asia-Pacific re-
gion, which resulted in the narrow scope of the research and the 
inability to quantify the generalization. However, the findings of the 
limited literature indicated that the AI curriculum for K-12 classrooms is 
a worthwhile investigation and highly valuable emerging research di-
rection for future researchers. As an increasing number of researchers 
focus on the field, more literature on the AI curriculum for K-12 class-
rooms could be included in future study.
