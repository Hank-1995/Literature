The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots has significantly influenced higher education in 
the last couple of years, with large language models (LLMs), such as Open AI’s Chat GPT, emerging as trans-
formative tools. Chat GPT is actively and widely adopted for academic applications, including tutoring, essay 
drafting, content clarification, and feedback generation. While its integration into educational settings offers 
numerous advantages, from enhancing learning outcomes and reducing test anxiety to fostering engagement and 
collaboration, it raises concerns regarding academic integrity, critical thinking, and over-reliance on AI- 
generated content. This paper presents a systematic review of existing literature on using Chat GPT in higher 
education, following a PRISMA-based methodology to analyze 39 studies published between 2023 and 2024. The 
review synthesizes findings across five key dimensions: academic performance, mental health, second-language 
learners, social influence, and inspiration. The results indicate that while Chat GPT improves accessibility to 
knowledge and provides cognitive and emotional support, its misuse may hinder independent learning and in-
crease technostress. Furthermore, this review explores ethical and policy considerations surrounding Chat GPT’s 
adoption, emphasizing the need for balanced integration strategies. Key recommendations include institutional 
guidelines, AI literacy initiatives, and frameworks for ethical integration. This review offers critical insights for 
educators, policymakers, and researchers seeking to navigate the evolving academic landscape shaped by AI.
1. Introduction
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming edu-
cation by reshaping how knowledge is delivered, consumed, and un-
derstood. Among these tools, large language models (LLMs) like 
Open AI’s Chat GPT have gained prominence for their advanced natural 
language processing (NLP) capabilities. LLMs are AI-based models 
trained on vast datasets, including text, images, and audio using self- 
supervised learning to perform tasks such as language generation, 
translation, and information extraction. Generative Pretrained Trans-
formers (GPTs), in particular, remain the most powerful LLMs due to 
their strength in predicting syntax, semantics, and meaning (Al Afnan 
et al., 2023).
Since GPT-1’s launch in 2018, Chat GPT has improved rapidly, with 
the latest version (GPT-4, 2024) offering better accuracy, alignment 
with user needs, real-time web access, and reduced harmful output 
(Rawas, 2024). Today, Chat GPT supports a range of academic uses, from 
tutoring and essay feedback to summarization and personalized study 
help, redefining traditional learning and promoting inclusive, adaptive 
education. The platform now exceeds 180 million monthly active users. 
Its popularity surged within two months of launch, reaching 100 million 
users, a record-breaking adoption rate (Singh, 2025). This growth re-
flects its intuitive design, cross-disciplinary value, and the rising demand 
for accessible AI tools amid digital transformation in education 
(Michel-Villarreal et al., 2023).
As researchers quickly recognized that the rise of generative AI in 
education is not merely a technological trend but a transformative 
movement, several studies have emerged regarding its impact on 
teaching methodologies, student learning and academic engagement, 
and institutional policies. For instance, Huang et al. (Huang et al., 2023)

demonstrated the efficacy of AI-driven personalized interventions in 
improving learning outcomes and self-regulation among students 
enrolled in technical courses, while others expressed concern regarding 
its potential negative impact on the development of critical learning and 
employability 
skills 
in 
undergraduate 
students, 
including 
problem-solving, critical thinking, reasoning, and creativity (Farrokhnia 
et al., 2024). Examining a different aspect relevant to education, yet 
equally critical, several studies found that integrating AI tools into 
learning environments had a significant emotional influence on under-
graduate students, including lessened test anxiety, trust and relief, but 
also disappointment and anxiety regarding false content, as well as 
isolation and loneliness (Acosta-Enriquez et al., 2024; Crawford et al., 
2024; Gao, 2024). Stadler et al. (Stadler et al., 2024) suggested that 
while LLMs reduce cognitive load during academic tasks, they may 
inadvertently promote superficial surface-level learning and reduce the 
quality of reasoning and argumentation. This raises important questions 
about whether convenience and efficiency come at the expense of in-
tellectual rigor.
Beyond cognitive impact, Chat GPT’s adoption is associated with 
various behavioral and psychological implications. Liu et al. (Liu, 2024) 
examined how writing anxiety among English as a Second Language 
(ESL) learners influenced their use of Chat GPT as an automated writing 
tool. Their findings revealed that Chat GPT effectively reduced writing 
anxiety and fostered a positive attitude toward academic writing. 
However, the same study noted that such perceived ease of use could 
lead to complacency in skill development, highlighting the risk of 
over-reliance on AI assistance at the expense of meaningfully acquiring 
and practicing a language. Similarly, Zogheib et al. (Zogheib & Zogheib, 
2024) and Gulati et al. (Gulati et al., 2024) investigated factors influ-
encing the adoption of Chat GPT among students, noting that perceived 
usefulness, ease of use, and trust significantly shaped behavioral in-
tentions. Gulati et al. (Gulati et al., 2024) further emphasized that 
habitual usage was a stronger predictor of adoption than perceived risk, 
suggesting that Chat GPT may become an ingrained part of a student’s 
study habits.
The ethical and equity considerations of Chat GPT adoption must also 
be addressed. While generative AI has the potential to democratize ac-
cess to quality education, disparities in digital literacy, access to tech-
nology, and the biased nonexclusive data currently used in creating 
LLMs may exacerbate existing educational inequities. Furthermore, the 
lack of transparency in AI algorithms and data privacy concerns also 
present major ethical dilemmas, as students and educators continue to 
struggle with issues of trust and accountability. Duong et al. (Duong 
et al., 2024) investigated the "dark side" of Chat GPT usage, concluding 
that compulsive reliance on the tool was associated with increased 
psychological distress, loneliness, and social avoidance. This study 
further identified that technostress exacerbated these effects, acting as a 
moderating factor.
The implications of Chat GPT adoption extend beyond individual 
learners to broader pedagogical practices and institutional policies. 
Sandu et al. (Sandu et al., 2024) conducted a case study in Australian 
higher education, revealing that while Chat GPT enhanced academic 
performance and engagement in data analytics courses by assisting 
students in interpreting complex datasets and generating structured 
responses, it struggled to address complex queries, underscoring the 
need for complementary human guidance. Similarly, Kim et al. (Kim, 
Majdara, & Olson, 2024) explored its use in engineering lab report 
writing, concluding that while Chat GPT improved genre understanding, 
it occasionally generated inaccurate or misleading content, necessitating 
careful supervision.
These findings underscore the complex interplay among the poten-
tial benefits and challenges closely intertwined in association with the 
use of Chat GPT in college students, emphasizing that its foreseen role as 
a positive educational transformation tool must be carefully and prag-
matically examined in the context of current learning agents and envi-
ronments. Whether AI can address key challenges in education, while 
navigating its complex and sometimes conflicting impacts remains 
largely unanswered.
The overlay visualization in Fig. 1 demonstrates the co-occurrence of 
keywords from literature concerning Chat GPT’s significance in higher 
education, particularly with learning, well-being, and collaboration 
during the period 2023–24. The node size denotes the frequency of 
keyword utilization, the edge thickness signifies the strength of co- 
occurrence, and the color gradient (2023–2024) illustrates the chrono-
logical evolution of study themes. Key concepts such as Chat GPT, stu-
dents, language models, and higher education underscore primary 
domains of investigation. Conversely, concepts such as contrastive 
learning, collaborative learning, and technology adoption are peripheral 
and more contemporary, indicating nascent or inadequately investi-
gated avenues. This map facilitates the identification of prevailing 
trends and research deficiencies, guiding future inquiries into the 
intricate influence of Chat GPT on educational practices and policies.
These five themes were identified through thematic synthesis and 
reflect how Chat GPT impacts students across three broad domains: 
cognitive (academic performance, second-language users), emotional 
(mental health), and behavioral (peer pressure, inspiration). This 
structure aligns with our second objective, which examines cognitive, 
emotional, and behavioral impacts in higher education.
Given the wide range of perspectives, a systematic review is essential 
to consolidate research on Chat GPT in education, addressing not only 
academic outcomes and risks but also the often-overlooked cognitive, 
emotional, and behavioral impacts. Fig. 2 outlines the contributions and 
gaps of recent systematic reviews (Baig & Yadegaridehkordi, 2024; Deng 
et al., 2025; Elbaz et al., 2024; García-L´opez et al., 2025; Garg et al., 
2023; G¨odde et al., 2023; Imran & Almusharraf, 2023; Levin et al., 2024; 
Lo, 2023; Lo et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024; Michel-Villarreal et al., 2023; 
Salih et al., 2025; Sallam, 2023; Vargas-Murillo et al., 2023; Zamfiroiu 
et al., 2023; Zhang & Tur, 2024; ˙Ipek et al., 2023).
Notably, Deng et al. (Deng et al., 2025) synthesized 22 systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses on educational outcomes, while Lo et al. (Lo 
et al., 2024) analyzed 14 detailed empirical studies. While these reviews 
focus on isolated themes, our review offers a more integrated perspec-
tive by connecting cognitive (learning), emotional (wellbeing), and so-
cial (collaboration) aspects. It also highlights interdisciplinary gaps, 
such as the lack of longitudinal data, variability across disciplines, and 
the underexplored role of collaboration.
This review addresses that gap through a uniquely integrated lens, 
synthesizing evidence across three interconnected domains: learning, 
well-being, and collaboration in higher education. Such a comprehen-
sive approach enables a deeper understanding of how Chat GPT is 
reshaping teaching practices, learner experiences, and institutional 
strategies. Importantly, insights from the accompanying bibliometric 
analysis reveal that despite growing interest in Chat GPT, the dimensions 
of well-being and collaboration alongside nuanced learning remain 
significantly underexplored in existing literature. This highlights the 
pressing need for a systematic synthesis that extends beyond conven-
tional outcome measures. To structure this effort, the review articulates 
a clear set of research objectives (Fig. 3a), each supported by corre-
sponding research questions (Fig. 3b). Together, they offer a roadmap 
for examining not just what has been studied, but also what needs to be 
addressed in future research to inform responsible and effective adop-
tion of Chat GPT in higher education.
The remainder of this article is structured as follows: Section 2
provides a brief overview of the adopted methodology and protocol, 
including the inclusion and exclusion criteria, search procedure, selec-
tion method, quality assessment, and data extraction and synthesis. 
Section 3 discusses the key findings, highlighting five key dimensions of 
the impact of Chat GPT in higher education: academic performance, 
mental health, second-language users, peer pressure, and inspiration, 
where the unique benefits and challenges are explored for each, as well 
as a brief description of faculty perspectives in association with these 
five dimensions. Section 4 compares Chat GPT with traditional study

methods. Section 5 presents the main limitations and key biases, while 
concluding remarks and future directions are provided in section 6.
2. Review methodology
A systematic literature review (SLR) was employed to evaluate and 
analyze the existing body of research on the application of Chat GPT in 
higher education. This review was conducted according to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement 
(PRISMA). The approach followed the framework outlined by Kitchen-
ham et al. (Kitchenham & Charters, 2007), which provides a structured 
methodology for minimizing bias and synthesizing research findings. 
The review process included the development of a review protocol, the 
definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the search and selection 
processes, quality assessment, and data extraction and synthesis. Addi-
tionally, the review specifically utilized a thematic qualitative synthesis 
approach, given the significant diversity in methodologies, outcomes, 
and contexts across the included studies, which precluded conducting a 
quantitative meta-analysis.
2.1. Review protocol
The review protocol aimed to reduce potential research bias by 
establishing predefined criteria and a systematic approach for identi-
fying, evaluating, and synthesizing relevant literature. This protocol 
guided the entire review process, ensuring transparency and 
replicability.
2.1.1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
To ensure the rigor and relevance of the review, well-defined in-
clusion and exclusion criteria were established and systematically 
applied during the study selection process. (a) Eligible studies were 
limited to peer-reviewed research articles published in English between 
January 2023 and mid-October 2024, (b) containing relevant keywords 
within the title, abstract, or keyword sections. (c) the review specifically 
focused on empirical investigations examining the application of 
Chat GPT in higher education settings, including both undergraduate 
and postgraduate learning environments. Studies were excluded (a) if 
they did not represent original research, such as editorials, 
commentaries, opinion pieces, meta-analyses, or grey literature. (b) 
articles published outside the specified timeframe or in languages other 
than English were also omitted. (c) in addition, studies that focused 
exclusively on K–12 education or pre-university diploma programs were 
excluded from consideration, as they fell outside the defined scope of 
this review.
2.1.2. Search procedure
Two authors (NA and RK) independently screened the titles and 
abstracts of potential studies without employing any automation tools. A 
comprehensive search was conducted across several relevant databases, 
including Emerald, ERIC, MDPI, SAGE, Elsevier, Springer Link, Frontiers, 
Plos One, Wiley, and Taylor & Francis. Boolean operators were employed 
to maximize the retrieval of relevant studies using search strings such as 
("Chat GPT ") AND ("higher education" OR "university" OR "undergrad-
uate" OR "graduate"). Any disagreements regarding the eligibility of an 
article were resolved through discussion.
2.1.3. Selection process
The selection process is outlined in Fig. 4. The automated search 
phase retrieved a total of 209 studies. After applying the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, 42 articles remained. A manual search yielded 30 
additional studies, resulting in 72 quality assessments. We excluded 33 
studies due to their low quality, leaving 39 articles for analysis. We 
removed duplicates before screening, and a second reviewer indepen-
dently validated a random subset to reduce bias.
2.1.4. Quality assessment
The quality of the selected studies (EQ) was evaluated using criteria 
adapted from Kitchenham and Charters (Kitchenham & Charters, 2007). 
● EQ1: Does the article explicitly discuss Chat GPT?
● EQ2: Does the article focus on Chat GPT in higher education?
● EQ3: Is the article a research study?
●EQ4: Does the article provide a clear research methodology?
Each study was scored on a scale of 0–2 per criterion (0 = not 
addressed, 1 = partially addressed, 2 = fully addressed), yielding a total 
possible score of 8. We classified studies scoring below 4 as weak, and

those scoring above 4 as medium or high. while scores above 4 were 
categorized as medium or high. The reviewers independently assessed 
all 72 initially eligible studies. Discrepancies were discussed and 
resolved jointly, ensuring consistency and minimizing bias in the in-
clusion process. As a result of this process, 33 studies were excluded due 
to failing to meet minimum quality standards. The most common issues 
among excluded papers were. 
1. Lack of clearly stated research objectives (EQ1 = 0)
2. Vague or missing methodological descriptions (EQ2 = 0 or 1)
3. Absence of evaluation metrics or outcome data (EQ3 = 0)
4. Editorial or anecdotal commentary without empirical basis (EQ4 =
0)

2.1.5. Data extraction and synthesis
The final stage involved extracting data from the remaining 39 
studies. Key information, such as research objectives, methods, results, 
and limitations, was systematically retrieved and tabulated. This process 
facilitated a detailed synthesis, enabling the identification of recurring 
themes, emerging trends, and significant gaps in the literature. Table I
presents a detailed summary of the studies, which includes objectives,

Explored Chat GPT’s role in an 
entrepreneurship course, assisting students in 
forming venture teams.
Three teams used Chat GPT to define roles, 
essential members, and equity splits based on 
prompts, with findings discussed in class. 
Post-intervention surveys assessed 
perceptions.
Students overwhelmingly favored Chat GPT, 
seeing it as a convenient and resourceful tool 
that supported entrepreneurial learning and 
venture creation.
Ngo et al. (2024)

Examined factors influencing students’ 
satisfaction and continued use of Chat GPT in 
education using the Expectation-Confirmation 
Model (ECM).
Collected survey data from 435 students 
across eight Vietnamese universities, 
analyzing four variables using CFA and SEM 
with SPSS 26 and AMOS 24.
Expectation confirmation and perceived 
usefulness positively impacted satisfaction and 
continued use. However, perceived usefulness 
did not directly influence satisfaction, 
suggesting trust and quality play a role. Students 
who found Chat GPT beneficial were more likely 
to keep using it.
Yin et al. (2024)

Investigated emotional responses and intrinsic 
motivation in micro-learning chatbots, 
comparing metacognitive versus neutral 
feedback.
Sixty-two college students were randomly 
assigned to a Metacognitive EC (reflective 
feedback) or Neutral EC (general feedback) 
group. Chatbots guided them through 
greetings, biology content, self-evaluation, 
and feedback.
Both groups experienced mostly positive 
emotions, but the Metacognitive EC group 
reported fewer negative emotions and weaker 
interest-related motivation, suggesting 
metacognitive feedback may not fully enhance 
intrinsic motivation.

2.1.6. Potential biases
Potential biases are inherent in reviewing articles and need to be 
mentioned here. For instance, selection bias was introduced here 
through the exclusion of non-English studies, which may limit the 
generalizability of our findings. Publication bias is another inherent 
factor. Studies reporting positive impacts of Chat GPT may have a higher 
likelihood of publication. Technological bias consists of any bias due to 
differences in internet access and technological familiarity of students 
and institutions, as well as bias in current data sets used to train AI tools. 
Finally, there is certainly a bias with respect to institutional policies due

Abbas et al. (2024)

Investigated the causes and consequences of 
Chat GPT usage among university students, 
focusing on academic performance and 
behavioral outcomes.
Study 1 developed and validated an 8-item 
Chat GPT usage scale (N = 165). Study 2 
employed a three-wave time-lagged design (N 
= 494) to examine workload, time pressure, 
and reward sensitivity as causes, and 
procrastination, memory loss, and academic 
performance as consequences.
Findings showed that higher academic workload 
and time pressure increased Chat GPT use, while 
sensitivity to rewards reduced it. Usage was 
associated with greater procrastination and 
memory loss, leading to lower academic 
performance. Indirect effects linked workload, 
time pressure, and reward sensitivity to these 
outcomes via Chat GPT usage.

tures. Fig. 5 shows a bar chart of paper distribution by country.
2.1.7. Risk of bias assessment
To further ensure the reliability of our findings, a structured risk of 
bias assessment was conducted on the included studies. We evaluated 
each article for potential selection, performance, and reporting biases, 
adapting a simplified framework from the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We 
examined studies for clarity in research questions, transparency in 
methodology, presence of control/comparison groups, and complete-
ness in reporting outcomes. While most studies provided sufficient detail 
to assess Some studies exhibited potential biases due to small sample 
sizes, lack of randomization, or insufficient control of confounding 
variables. These limitations were considered when interpreting the 
overall strength and consistency of the evidence.
3. Discussion
This systematic review identifies five key dimensions of the impact of 
Chat GPT in higher education: academic performance, mental health, 
second-language users, peer pressure, and inspiration. Table II shows 
how many studies fall into each of these categories, and Table III ana-
lyzes how often each theme appears in the studies, showing which areas 
are most common. Each theme reflects unique benefits and challenges, 
offering a comprehensive perspective on the role of Chat GPT in trans-
forming educational practices. Specifically, this thematic structure 
captures three primary types of impacts: cognitive impacts are reflected 
in academic performance and second-language users, addressing how 
Chat GPT influences learning, comprehension, and critical thinking; 
emotional impacts are explored in mental health, highlighting effects on 
stress, anxiety, and confidence; and behavioral impacts are examined 
through peer pressure and inspiration, focusing on usage patterns, peer 
influence, and creative engagement. This section elaborates on each of 
these dimensions, highlighting the literature’s perspectives on associ-
ated advantages and shortcomings.
3.1. Academic performance
This theme primarily represents the cognitive impacts of Chat GPT, 
including enhancements in comprehension, problem-solving, and 
learning efficiency, as well as concerns about reduced critical thinking 
and analytical depth. A clear majority of the reviewed papers (56.4 %) 
report measurable academic gains associated with Chat GPT adoption. 
Multiple studies across engineering, programming and data-analytics 
courses document higher task scores, improved solution accuracy and 
richer formative feedback when students use the tool for step-by-step 
explanations or debugging assistance (Huang et al., 2023; Johnson 
et al., 2024; Sandu et al., 2024; Serhan & Welcome, 2024). These ben-
efits appear strong when Chat GPT is deployed as a supplementary tutor 
that provides personalized support and frees up classroom time for 
deeper discussion. Yet a consistent cautionary thread emerges 
over-reliance on AI-generated answers can erode critical-thinking and 
argument-construction skills (Farrokhnia et al., 2024; Gammoh, 2024; 
Stadler et al., 2024). Several authors note that although cognitive load is 
reduced, students may default to surface-level reasoning or accept 
unverified output, thereby compromising learning depth. Overall, the 
evidence shows that teaching methods, like having students review or 
fix Chat GPT answers, are important to improve performance while still 
keeping strong thinking skills.
3.2. Mental health
This theme reflects the emotional dimension of Chat GPT use, 
capturing both positive effects like reduced anxiety and increased self- 
efficacy, and negative effects such as technostress and emotional fa-
tigue in cases of overreliance. Roughly one quarter of the corpus (15 %) 
links Chat GPT use to reduced test anxiety, increased academic buoyancy 
and greater self-efficacy (Chambers & Owen, 2024; Gao, 2024; Sayed 
et al., 2024). Immediate feedback and on-demand clarification appear to 
lower stress, especially in high-stakes or time-pressured settings. This 
aligns with findings by Elbaz et al. (Elbaz et al., 2024), who explored 
students’ emotional and ethical responses to Chat GPT, reporting that its 
use in Omani higher education contexts influenced not only academic 
confidence but also raised concerns related to morality and stress. 
Conversely, a smaller but noteworthy set of studies highlights a “dark 
side”: compulsive or habitual use correlates with technostress, social 
avoidance and diminished life satisfaction when the tool displaces peer 
or instructor interaction (Duong et al., 2024; Feng et al., 2023; Yin et al., 
2024). The balance of evidence therefore positions Chat GPT as a po-
tential emotional buffer, provided institutions couple access with 
digital-wellbeing guidance, emphasizing moderation and encouraging 
human support networks.

3.3. Second-language users
The cognitive impact is particularly notable in this theme, as 
Chat GPT supports language comprehension, vocabulary development, 
and communication skills for second-language learners, helping to 
bridge gaps in understanding. About 13 % of studies focus on English-as- 
a-Second-Language (ESL) populations. Most report improvements in 
writing structure, vocabulary range and speaking proficiency when 
learners employ Chat GPT for real-time paraphrasing or pronunciation 
tips (Koltovskaia et al., 2024; Liu, 2024; Sayed et al., 2024). Students 
appreciate the “24/7 language partner” role and the ability to request 
multiple rephrasing until meaning is clear. However, two recurring 
concerns surface: (i) inaccurate or culturally insensitive outputs in lan-
guages with smaller training corpora (Houston & Corrado, 2023), and 
(ii) the risk that continual AI correction blunts autonomous language 
development. Effective instructional designs therefore blend Chat GPT 
with active production tasks in which learners compare their original 
drafts against AI suggestions and justify acceptance or rejection of each 
change.
3.4. Peer pressure
This theme captures a clear behavioral impact, where the decision to 
adopt or heavily rely on Chat GPT is influenced by peer dynamics, 
competition, and the pressure to keep pace with others. Although only 5 
% of papers center explicitly on peer dynamics, social influence 
consistently emerges as a powerful adoption driver. Students report 
feeling compelled to use Chat GPT to keep pace with classmates who 
leverage it for speed or grade advantage (Gulati et al., 2024; Zogheib & 
Zogheib, 2024). This is consistent with findings from Strzelecki et al. 
(Strzelecki, 2024), who highlights that students’ acceptance and use of 
Chat GPT are significantly shaped by perceived usefulness, ease of use, 
and social norms, including the influence of peers in academic settings. 
This competitive uptake amplifies equity gaps where connectivity or 
device access is uneven. Institutional responses cited in the literature 
include campus-wide licenses, mandatory AI-literacy workshops, and 
collaborative assignments that reward transparent sharing of 
prompt-engineering strategies, all aimed at diffusing pressure and pro-
moting equitable participation.
3.5. Inspiration and creativity
This theme represents both a behavioral impact, as students use 
Chat GPT to initiate and guide their creative processes, and a cognitive 
shift, where idea generation and problem-solving are influenced by AI- 
driven suggestions. Roughly one in ten studies investigate Chat GPT as 
a creativity catalyst. Learners credit the tool with breaking writer’s 
block, expanding idea space and offering fresh analogies (Hammoda, 
2024; Salah et al., 2024). Yet the same papers warn that effortless idea 
generation can dampen originality and reduce confidence in 
self-generated concepts. Investigations comparing divergent- and 
convergent-question prompts show that creative gains are greatest when

students iteratively refine AI suggestions rather than accepting first-pass 
outputs (Leung & Lo, 2024). Effective practice therefore frames 
Chat GPT as a brainstorming partner whose contributions must be 
critiqued, remixed and properly attributed.
3.6. Integrated insights and research gaps
In summary, cognitive impacts include enhanced comprehension, 
faster learning, and concerns about reduced critical thinking. Emotional 
impacts are reflected in reduced anxiety, stress management, and con-
fidence boosts, balanced by the risk of technostress. Behavioral impacts 
are seen in usage patterns shaped by peer influence, reliance habits, and 
AI-driven creative workflows. Across themes, two broad patterns 
converge. 
• Value-add through personalization and immediacy, Chat GPT excels 
at micro-scaffolded guidance, anxiety reduction, and multilingual 
support.
• Risk of skill atrophy through over-reliance, critical thinking, deep 
reading and original ideation can suffer when AI responses are taken 
at face value.
Notably absent are longitudinal studies tracking sustained learning 
habits and controlled comparisons that isolate Chat GPT’s incremental 
effect over existing digital tools. Future work should also examine dif-
ferential impacts across disciplines with distinct epistemic practices (e. 
g., humanities vs. STEM) and investigate institutional policies that bal-
ance innovation with integrity.
Collectively, the evidence positions Chat GPT as a double-edged 
pedagogical innovation: a potent enhancer of accessibility, feedback 
and learner confidence when embedded within reflective, ethically 
grounded curricula; a potential detractor when used as a shortcut that 
circumvents cognitive effort. Educators, technologists and policymakers 
must therefore co-design guidelines that harness their strengths while 
safeguarding core academic values.
3.7. Ethical and policy considerations
Several studies in this review briefly acknowledge the ethical and 
policy implications of Chat GPT’s integration into higher education, 
although few address them in depth. The main worries often mentioned 
are about academic integrity, where using AI-generated answers could 
harm the fairness of assessments if they are misused for cheating or 
getting help without giving credit (as Elbaz et al. (Elbaz et al., 2024)). 
Others highlight data privacy and surveillance, particularly in institu-
tional contexts where AI tools are embedded into learning platforms that 
collect student inputs.
The model may show algorithmic bias, especially in places that are 
not English-speaking or are culturally diverse, by a lack of representa-
tion or produce stereotypical results (Michel-Villarreal et al. 
(Michel-Villarreal et al., 2023)). Furthermore, digital equity is discussed 
in studies focused on global South contexts, where disparities in access 
and digital literacy may lead to unequal academic outcomes.
To address these issues, a few papers propose guidelines such as 
promoting AI literacy, setting transparent usage policies, and encour-
aging critical engagement with AI outputs (Michel-Villarreal et al., 
2023; Strzelecki, 2024). However, most authors agree that clearer 
institutional frameworks are needed to balance innovation with fairness, 
privacy, and academic standards (Elbaz et al., 2024). A more robust 
ethical discussion in future studies is essential to help educators and 
policymakers ensure the responsible use of AI in higher education.
4. Chat GPT versus traditional study methods
The integration of Chat GPT in higher education has introduced new 
dynamics in student learning, faculty strategies, and the experience of 
second-language learners. This section explores how Chat GPT compares 
to traditional study methods, its multifaceted roles for students, strate-
gies for faculty to address critical thinking challenges, and its impact on 
second-language students. The adoption of Chat GPT has transformed 
traditional study methods, offering students immediate access to infor-
mation and personalized assistance (Johnson et al., 2024). Unlike con-
ventional methods that rely heavily on textbooks, lectures, and peer 
discussions, Chat GPT provides instant explanations and clarifications, 
improving the learning process. However, this convenience may come at 
the cost of reduced engagement with material and diminished critical 
thinking. Over-reliance on AI tools might hinder deep comprehension 
and problem-solving skills (H. K. Kim, Nayak, et al., 2024).
4.1. Chat GPT as a personalized tutor, counselor, interpreter, mentor, and 
friend
Beyond serving as an academic assistant, Chat GPT has been used in a 
variety of supportive roles for students, including acting as a tutor by 
offering explanations and guidance on academic subjects, a counselor by 
providing stress-relief strategies and time-management tips, an inter-
preter by assisting non-native speakers in understanding and translating 
content, a mentor by guiding career planning and personal develop-
ment, and even as a friend through casual conversation and compan-
ionship (Acosta-Enriquez et al., 2024; Taniguchi et al., 2019). This 
multifaceted functionality can enhance the student experience by of-
fering support across both academic and personal domains; however, it 
may also increase students’ over-reliance on emotional support, poten-
tially impacting their social development.
4.2. Critical thinking and academic resilience
The ease of access to information through Chat GPT may discourage 
students from deep engagement and critical analysis. To mitigate this, 
faculty can adopt several strategies. One approach is to promote active 
learning by encouraging methods that require students to analyze, 
evaluate, and create, thereby fostering deeper understanding. Another 
strategy involves integrating assignments that ask students to critique 
the accuracy and reliability of Chat GPT-generated content, which helps 
sharpen their evaluative skills (Stadler et al., 2024; D. Kim, Nayak, et al., 
2024). Additionally, setting clear guidelines on the appropriate use of 
AI, emphasizing its role as a supplementary aid rather than a primary 
source, can help frame its purpose more effectively. Finally, offering 
workshops on digital literacy can educate students about both the 
strengths and limitations of AI tools, encouraging informed and 
responsible use.
4.3. Chat GPT’s role and second-language students
For students learning in a non-native language, Chat GPT serves as a 
valuable resource by assisting with language clarification, helping them 
understand complex terminology and idiomatic expressions. It also 
supports writing improvement through grammar and style suggestions, 
aiding in the development of stronger writing skills. Additionally, it 
offers pronunciation guidance, providing phonetic assistance to enhance 
spoken language proficiency. While these features can significantly 
support language acquisition, it is crucial for students to balance AI 
assistance with active language practice to ensure comprehensive skill 
development.
4.4. Key research findings
Aligned with the six research questions (RQ1–RQ6) shown in Fig. 3b, 
key findings from the reviewed studies are summarized in Fig. 6. For 
RQ1 (Academic Performance), multiple studies report that Chat GPT 
supports learning by offering personalized feedback, clarifying complex 
topics, and improving writing and reading skills. However, some studies 
N. Abdallah et al.

warn that unguided use may encourage surface-level learning and 
reduce critical thinking (Huang et al., 2023; Sandu et al., 2024). These 
mixed results likely reflect differences in usage strategies, learner pro-
files, and context.
Regarding RQ2 (well-being), Chat GPT can ease academic anxiety but 
raises concerns about overdependence and reduced motivation, espe-
cially under stress. Likewise, RQ3 (second -language learners) shows 
Chat GPT helps improve academic voice and engagement through better 
grammar, content refinement, and writing fluency. For RQ4 (Peer 
Pressure), peer influence plays a major role in adoption. Students often 
follow peer trends more than institutional rules. Moreover, RQ5 (Crea-
tivity and Inspiration) highlights Chat GPT’s value as a brainstorming 
tool that supports divergent thinking and creative exploration when 
used interactively. Finally, RQ6 (Ethical and Policy Implications) raises 
concerns about academic integrity, authorship, and access equity. Most 
studies recommend clear institutional guidelines and digital literacy 
training to ensure responsible use.

5. Conclusions and future directions
Our review underscores Chat GPT’s growing influence in higher ed-
ucation, offering clear benefits such as enhanced learning, reduced 
anxiety, and fast personalized feedback. Its popularity among students 
positions it as a powerful academic tool. However, concerns remain 
around over-reliance, reduced critical thinking, academic integrity, and 
equity issues. These challenges highlight the need for thoughtful inte-
gration supported by ethical guidelines, AI literacy, and multidisci-
plinary collaboration. Institutions must adopt balanced strategies that 
promote Chat GPT’s strengths while addressing its risks. This includes 
training educators and students on ethical use, developing culturally 
sensitive AI frameworks, and tailoring adoption across academic disci-
plines. The global scope of reviewed studies adds valuable insights but 
also introduces limitations due to varying methods, contexts, and 
languages.
Future research should include longitudinal studies to assess long- 
term impacts on learning and critical thinking. Greater focus is also 
needed on underrepresented regions, emotional well-being, and 
discipline-specific applications. Robust, transparent frameworks are 
essential to ensure responsible use that prioritizes academic integrity 
and inclusivity. As AI continues to shape education, ongoing research 
and policy development will be key to ensuring that tools like Chat GPT 
enhance, not replace, the core values of higher education.
