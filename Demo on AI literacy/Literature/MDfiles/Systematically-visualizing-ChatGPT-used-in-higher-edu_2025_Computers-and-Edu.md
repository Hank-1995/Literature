Since it was released in November 2022, Chat GPT has been exerting revolutionary influence on the realm of 
higher education. In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the research landscape, we conduct a 
systematic literature review on the studies of Chat GPT used in higher education. Both quantitative and quali-
tative methods were adopted to bibliometrically examine the included literature selected from Web of Science 
and Scopus through the PRISMA protocol. Tools of VOSviewer and Cit Net Explorer were employed to visualize 
the citation information. Our findings showed that the recent two years witnessed an ever-growing popularity of 
this research theme. Citation information analysis reveals the most influential authors, countries, sources, or-
ganizations and four focused topics. The disciplinary distribution of related research indicates a wide range of 
categories. More importantly, Chat GPT was found to be versatile in assisting teachers, students and researchers 
with a variety of tasks, and the factors influencing the acceptance of this technology among college students 
could be investigated through models like TAM, UTAUT and their extensions. We suggest future studies to focus 
on the ways to address the limitations and ethical issues of Chat GPT through AI literacy cultivation and joint 
efforts of all stakeholders.
1. Introduction
As one of the most representative technologies in Industry 4.0, 
generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) has taken the world by storm 
in recent years. Chat GPT, an generative pre-trained transformer that can 
produce human-like text and conduct interactive conversation, is one of 
the most representative Gen AI products. Since its advent in November 
2022, it has been gaining popularity and exerting its influence on the 
realm of higher education. Compared to previous educational technol-
ogies, Chat GPT stands out for its interactive and natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) capabilities. Its vast pre-trained data on extensive publicly 
available sources and reinforcement learning from human feedback 
made it a useful tool to perform various language processing tasks 
(Alqahtani et al., 2023). This feature significantly enhances user 
engagement and accessibility, enabling more intuitive and conversa-
tional learning experiences. Besides, Chat GPT can potentially provide 
personalized learning experiences tailored to individual students’ needs 
and abilities (Azaiz, Deckarm, & Strickroth, 2023; H. Lee, 2023). This 
represents a significant advancement over traditional educational tools, 
which generally offered non-specific content.
The significance of Chat GPT in higher education is highlighted in its 
capabilities to assist teachers, students, and researchers with various 
educational tasks (Ansari, Ahmad, & Bhutta, 2023). Specific case studies 
have demonstrated the revolutionary impact of Chat GPT on higher ed-
ucation since its release. On the one hand, Chat GPT significantly boosts 
educational support and accessibility. Its widespread availability offers 
comprehensive educational assistance, thereby reducing educational 
barriers and fostering a more inclusive learning atmosphere. For 
example, A university in the United Arab Emirates has integrated 
Chat GPT into its library service to provide 24/7 access to academic 
support. Students and faculty who need academic support and service 
outside 
the 
regular 
working 
hours 
can 
interact 
with 
the 
Chat GPT-powered robot to receive instant feedback and explanations 
(Lappalainen & Narayanan, 2023). On the other hand, Chat GPT en-
courages creativity and critical thinking, engaging learners with inno-
vative approaches and analytical mindsets. A chemistry course has 
incorporated Chat GPT into its curriculum to encourage students to 
engage in AI-based activities. Significant improvements were noticed in 
students’ confidence to ask insightful questions, analyze information, 
and comprehend complex concepts (Guo & Lee, 2023). These case

studies demonstrate how Chat GPT has revolutionized higher education 
by enhancing learning support, driving innovation in teaching methods, 
streamlining administrative tasks, and fostering critical thinking and 
creativity among college teachers and students.
Meanwhile, concerns and controversies regarding the challenges and 
potential risks came along. The academia worried that the use of 
Chat GPT would lead to more plagiarism in scholarly writing (Singh, 
2023). And the hallucination issue, which refers to generating 
non-existent or incorrect content, raised people’s concerns on its lia-
bility (Alqahtani et al., 2023). Challenges also lie in privacy infringe-
ment, algorithmic bias, ethical considerations and so forth (Bannister, 
Urbieta, & Penalver, 2023; Dempere, Modugu, Hesham, & Ramasamy, 
2023; Farrelly & Baker, 2023).
Current research on Chat GPT in higher education, while making 
progress, still exhibits several notable gaps. Since potential risks and 
ethical considerations come along with the emergence of Chat GPT, some 
research overemphasized the negative impact while neglecting 
Chat GPT’s diverse applications and achievements in educational sector. 
Secondly, in view of the ever-growing popularity of Gen AI, the existing 
literature reviews failed to catch up with the latest studies, necessitating 
inclusion of new publications. Thirdly, there is a lack of evidence to 
explain the causes behind Chat GPT’s varying performance across 
different subjects. Finally, while existing studies have explored 
Chat GPT’s usage in higher education from different perspectives, they 
have not yet done an in-depth investigation of each single theme.
In order to address these research gaps, this systematic literature 
review will focus on the latest high-quality academic publications per-
taining to Chat GPT used in the context of higher education. Bibliometric 
approaches will be employed to analyze the publication trend, the most 
focused disciplinary domains, the main themes and the acceptance 
models. By doing so, it aims to provide a comprehensive understanding 
of the current research landscape. This will not only facilitate the 
identification of the most critical issues but also suggest directions for 
future studies.
2. Literature review
Table 1 shows four existing literature reviews investigating Chat GPT 
used within the context of higher education ranked in chronological 
order. Following the guideline proposed by Kraus et al. (2022), we 
categorized the included four reviews into systematic literature review 
(SLR) and non-systematic literature review (non-SLR) considering 
whether there was a protocol for guiding data curation and analysis. In 
these reviews, Chat GPT is sometimes synonymously referred to as 
“generative artificial intelligence”, “Gen AI” or “large language model 
(LLM)”. Given the fact that the four reviews were written in earlier 2023, 
it is essential to incorporate more recent advancements to provide a 
more comprehensive view of current academic landscape. To achieve 
this, we aim to include the most recent high-quality publications and 
analyze their features, so as to address the following research questions. 
RQ1: What is the publication trend of the literature in the field of 
Chat GPT-assisted higher education since the launch of Chat GPT?
RQ2: Who are the top 10 authors, sources, organizations and coun-
tries based on citation data in the field of Chat GPT-assisted higher 
education?
RQ3: What disciplinary domains have current studies mainly 
engaged with?
RQ4: What are the major themes discussed by current publications?
As a non-systematic review, Farrelly and Baker (2023) critically 
explored the multifaceted impact of Gen AI on higher education. They 
believe that Chat GPT, as a rising star in AI family, is more disruptive to 
higher education and society than previous inventions. Since the overall 
research was not systematically conducted, their research findings are 
far from convincing.
Adopting the thematic analysis approach, Bannister et al. (2023)
touched on a wide rage of themes regarding AI’s applications and im-
plications in higher education, including language instruction, student 
learning, assessment and feedback, research activity, academic integrity 
and policy. Dempere et al. (2023) generally discussed both the advan-
tages and potential risks of integrating Chat GPT into higher education. 
Ansari et al. (2023) mapped the global evidence of Chat GPT’s applica-
tions in higher education, offering an insight into the contextual, 
methodological and disciplinary scopes of this research field. Although 
these reviews provided a initial overview of Gen AI’s current status in 
higher education, a more in-depth investigation needs to be carried out 
to elucidate each research theme.
In summary, existing reviews, while shedding light on the overall 
trend and disciplinary distribution of Chat GPT-related research in 
higher education, left some important issues under-explored, such as the 
major themes discussed, the specific roles of Chat GPT, and the dynamics 
of user acceptance. To fill these gaps, we propose the following research 
questions. 
RQ5: How can Chat GPT be effectively integrated into the learning, 
teaching and research processes in higher education?
RQ6: How does the performance of Chat GPT vary across different 
disciplines?
RQ7: What is the extent of adoption and acceptance of Chat GPT 
among college students?
These questions will focuses on mining out the existing research 
themes, summarizing the specific roles of Chat GPT in assisting college 
teaching, learning and research and exploring the factors influencing 
user’s adoption and acceptance of Chat GPT in higher education, areas 
that previously received limited attention.
3. Methods
3.1. Research design
As shown in Fig. 1, we aimed at carrying out the systematic review 
with the guidance of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re-
views and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 (Page et al., 2021), a protocol 
widely recognized for providing a robust framework for conducting 
systematic reviews. VOSviewer and Cit Net Explorer, two powerful sci-
ence mapping tools, were employed to visualize and analyze biblio-
metric networks. VOSviewer is a software developed for constructing 
bibliometric maps based on the metadata from the included publica-
tions. Its versatile display techniques enable researchers to view a map 
in full detail (van Eck & Waltman, 2010). Similarly, Cit Net Explorer

offers detailed visualizations of citation networks, allowing users to 
identify key researchers and research areas and analyze the structure 
and dynamics of scientific fields, capturing the development of a 
research field over time (van Eck & Waltman, 2014). VOSviewer and 
Cit Net Explorer significantly enhanced the analysis of citation informa-
tion by generating comprehensible and analyzable citation networks, 
offering deeper insights into the scientific landscape of a given research 
area.
3.2. Databases and search strategy
We conducted our literature search on March 14, 2024, utilizing Web 
of Science (the Core Collection) and SCOPUS, two of the most authori-
tative and comprehensive literature databases, as our searching re-
sources. We attempted to identify relevant articles by imputing search 
strings with Boolean operators. The first one is “Chat GPT OR GPT* OR 
“Open AI” OR “Generative AI” OR “Generative Artificial Intelligence” 
OR “Gen AI” OR “large language model*”” with the Titles; the second 
one is “college OR university OR “higher education” OR “higher 
institut*” OR “Tertiary Education”” with the Topics. They were jointly 
used to ensure that all peer-reviewed texts with regard to Chat GPT used 
in higher education were possibly collected. As a result, a total of 1018 
peer-reviewed articles were identified.
3.3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Table 2 shows the inclusion and exclusion criteria to filter out papers 
relevant and eligible for our research in a three-step approach. In the 
first step was to exclude articles published before November 30th, 2022, 
the date of Chat GPT-3.5 emergence and duplicate publications. In the 
second step, we restricted the criteria to obtain the most relevant articles 
which (1) focus on the use of Chat GPT or other large language models, 
(2) pertain to the background of higher education, (3) have complete 
components of an academic article, including abstract, introduction, 
methodology, findings, discussion, references and so on, and (4) have 
accessible Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Consequently, 234 relevant 
articles were filtered, which would be specifically used to answer RQ1 to 
RQ4.

Subsequently, we adopted Standards for Reporting on Empirical 
Social Science Research in AERA Publications: American Educational 
Research Association (Association, 2006) to assess the quality of the 
relevant publications. In the evaluation process, scores were given to 
each relevant article from eight aspects, namely problem formulation, 
design and logic, source of evidence, measurement and classification, 
analysis and interpretation, generalization, ethics, title, abstract and 
headings. Two trained and experienced reviewers participated in the 
quality assessment with rigorous adherence to the established criteria, 
and a third rater was invited to help the decision making whenever there 
was a disagreement. The final inter-rater reliability reached a satisfac-
tory level (k = 0.886). Furthermore, the four literature reviews previous 
analyzed were also included. Ultimately, 67 highly-rated articles 
(marked with asterisks in the references) were selected for further evi-
dence extraction and analysis to answer RQ5 to RQ7.
3.4. Content analysis
In order to better address the research questions and achieve our 
research objectives, we conducted a content analysis of the selected 
studies. We extracted and analyzed the information both descriptively 
and thematically. The first focus is the publication trend of related 
publications. With the help of VOSviewer, we delved into the top au-
thors, countries, sources, organizations of all 234 relevant publications. 
The specific disciplines in each document were identified and catego-
rized and major themes among all relevant articles were synthesized 
through keywords clusters. As for the thematic analysis, the researchers 
read the 67 highly-rated articles to extract evidence pertaining to the 
applications and effectiveness of Chat GPT in real educational practice 
and its performance across different disciplines. Citation network anal-
ysis through Cite Net Explorer was conducted to visualize the citation 
relationship among studies dedicated to investigating the acceptance 
and adoption of Chat GPT in higher education.
4. Results
4.1. Publication trend (RQ1)
Since the research was conducted just 18 months after the emergence 
of Chat GPT, it is more appropriate to examine the publication trend of 
Chat GPT-assisted higher education on a monthly basis rather than an 
annual basis. Researchers meticulously identified the publishing time or 
early access date of each relevant document from the given information 
within the databases. In the case of unstated publishing time, the 
indexed time was utilized.
It was discovered that general publication trend went through a 
constant upward tendency with occasional minor fluctuations from 
January 2023 to March 2024, which reflected the ever-growing popu-
larity of Chat GPT in the realm of higher education. The first article of 
this academic interest was published in February 2023, after which the 
number rose gradually with an increase of 2–3 in the subsequent five 
months, soaring to its first peak in July. After that, the upward trend 
continued, with the number almost doubling in October, indicating a 
sustained growth in the academic attention on Chat GPT in higher 
education.
This uprising tendency might be attributed to several factors: (1) the 
accumulation of empirical evidence on using Chat GPT in various 
educational settings, (2) the emergence of more critical reflections on its 
implications for education, and (3) the comparison with other newly- 
launched AI chatbots. Thus, it can be predicted that in the near future 
this academic momentum will remain strong due to more diversified 
applications of Chat GPT and deeper investigation into its dynamics 
within higher educational sector.
4.2. Citation information analysis (RQ2)
We use the citation analysis function of VOSviewer to obtain top 10 
authors, countries, sources, organizations respectively (Table 3). For a 
given item, the citation links attribute indicates the number of links of an 
item with other items, while total link strength attribute indicates the 
total strength of the links of an item with other items (van Eck & 
Waltman, 2010). Therefore these values are significantly valuable in 
reflecting the academic influence of each item.
Among the top 10 most cited authors, it is not surprising that 
Open AI, as the inventor company of Chat GPT, was the most frequently 
cited author among all the studies, followed by Rudolph, J., Venkatesh, 
V. and Dwivedi, Y. The scope of most cited countries ranged from North 
America, Europe, Asia African to Oceania, which reflected the wide-
spread attraction for Gen AI technology. The top three countries with the 
biggest amount of documents were USA, China and Australia. Never-
theless, if ranked by citation value, this sequence becomes England, 
Australia and USA. The top 10 most cited sources and organizations 
were obtain through similar methods.
These citation analysis data offered us an insight into the academic 
influence of different authors, countries, sources and organizations, 
which are beneficial for researchers in searching and selecting literature 
in this regard.
4.3. Disciplinary distribution of Chat GPT-related researches in higher 
education (RQ3)
In order to summarize the disciplinary distribution of the filtered 
publications, we adopted International Standard Classification of Edu-
cation (ISCED) framework (UNESCO, 2012) to classify the 234 relevant 
literature into different disciplinary domains where 7 broad groups and 
17 education fields were identified, as displayed in Table 4.
Some documents were categorized into two or more groups due to 
their multidisciplinary nature. General education was the most heated 
area, followed by Health and welfare and Science. In these intensively 
studied areas, the scope of categories tended to be tremendously 
extensive. For example, the fields of medicine in Health and welfare 
encompassed a wide range of sub-disciplinary branches, including 
Dermatology, 
Obstetrics 
Gynecology, 
Rheumatology, 
Urology 
Nephrology, Oncology, Ophthalmology, Otorhinolaryngology, Surgery, 
Radiology, Nuclear Medicine, Medical Imaging, and General Internal.
However, studies were sparsely distributed in humanities and arts, 
services, engineering manufacturing and construction. In particular, 
they were barely found in fields like fine arts, law, agriculture, veteri-
nary, transport services and security services.
4.4. Major topics discussed by the relevant literature(RQ4)
Fig. 2 demonstrates the co-occurrence network of all keywords 
encompassing author keywords and those derived from titles and ab-
stracts. The network distinctly shows seven colored clusters pivoting 
around three core knots: “Chat GPT” “artificial intelligence” and “higher 
education”. By examining the keywords within one or two adjacent 
clusters, we identified four major themes (Table 5).
The first theme “applications of Chat GPT in teaching, learning and 
research in higher education”, aligning with the RQ5, highlights 
Chat GPT’s powerful text-generation and conversational capabilities. It 
explores how these capabilities can assist learners, educators and re-
searchers with a variety of tasks, ranging from course design, making 
assessment to cultivating skills, fostering innovation and promoting 
communication.
The second theme, resonating with RQ6, involves empirical studies 
and data that evaluate and compare Chat GPT’s actual performance 
across different subjects.
The third theme focuses on researchers’ efforts in examining stu-
dents’ adoption and acceptance of Chat GPT. This is achieved through 
T. Ma

experiments that investigate various determinants influencing its inte-
gration into educational practice, thereby it could help address RQ7.
The keywords constituting the fourth theme reflect the academia’s 
considerations upon the inevitable challenges, risks and limitations 
posed by the rapid evolution of AI technology and its growing integra-
tion with educational practice.
4.5. Applications and effectiveness of Chat GPT in assisting higher 
education (RQ5)
Chat GPT has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in a wide range 
of tasks. Its effectiveness stems from its capabilities to understand and 
respond to complex queries, provide relevant information, and generate 
creative contents. Applications and effectiveness of Chat GPT for assist-
ing college teachers, students and researchers in real educational prac-
tice are summarized based on the evidence from the included 67 
literature sources, as shown in Fig. 3.
4.5.1. Chat GPT as a teaching assistant
4.5.1.1. Material generation. Based-on its powerful natural language 
processing nature, Chat GPT have been used to assist teachers in gener-
ating useful and personalized contents with naturalness and diversifi-
cation, including lesson plans, concept explanations, teaching 
documentations, students exercises and brainstorming questions and 
answers and even laboratory reports etc., thus incredibly saving time 
and improving teachers’ working efficiency (Meron & Araci, 2023; 
Podlasov & Matviichuk, 2023; West et al., 2023).
By combining Chat GPT with existing question banks and specific 
models, it compiles personalized questions that match the correspond-
ing abilities for different levels of student groups (Niu & Xue, 2023). A 
survey made by Korean researchers to evaluate teachers’ perceptions of 
readings from two distinct sources revealed that Chat GPT-developed 
readings were perceived as similar in terms of the target passages’ 
flow and expressions, indicating Chat GPT’s effectiveness in L2 teaching 
(Shin 
& 
Lee, 
2023). 
In 
mathematics 
and 
STEM 
courses, 
Chat GPT-generated final-exam questions could rival human-written 
questions in terms of quality, appropriateness and difficulty, high-
lighting its potential to streamline the production and assessment of 
large-scale exams and to significantly reduce faculty’s workload from 
days to mere seconds (Drori et al., 2023, pp. 3947–3955).
4.5.1.2. Assessment and evaluation. Chat GPT has shown significant 
value in assisting teachers with homework assessments through scoring, 
giving feedback, providing detailed instructions, etc. This will incredibly 
relieve teachers’ workload given fact that delivering timely and 
personalized feedback is particularly time-consuming in large classes in 
higher education (Azaiz et al., 2023).
A mixed-methods investigation conducted in a research university in 
southern China suggested that Chat GPT facilitated teachers’ assess-
ments in academic writing by cultivating better understanding of 
teachers’ evaluation, encouraging students to make judgement and 
think independently regarding revisions. Chat GPT’s efficiency in scoring 
students’ writing was confirmed by the intraclass correlation coefficient 
with moderate to good consistency with teacher evaluations (Lu et al., 
2024). In a study exploring Chat GPT’s capability in analyzing students’

course evaluation comments, there was a high level of agreement be-
tween human and machine identified themes with the range from 0.71 
to 0.82 for course-related topics, and Chat GPT users demonstrated 
higher agreement with one another than with the evaluators. On 
average, teachers took more than twice the time (27.50 ± 15.00 min) to 
analyze their data than Chat GPT users did (10.50 ± 1.00 min), greatly 
surpassing human instructors in evaluation efficiency while maintaining 
accuracy and consistency (A. Fuller, Morbitzer, Zeeman, Persky A. 
CSavage, & Mc Laughlin, 2024).
4.5.1.3. Teaching approach enhancement. Chat GPT was adopted by ed-
ucators to enhance and diversify teaching approaches. Studies have 
highlighted Chat GPT’s capabilities in enhancing teaching efficiency, 
creating an engaging learning environment and personalizing learning 
process in various online learning modes. In the field of remote learning, 
Chat GPT holds promising potentials (Sisilitsyn & V. Osadchyi, 2023). It 
is revealed that generative AI tools are crucial in developing massive 
MOOC virtual classrooms where teacher can design and deliver 
personalized and enriching educational experiences (Ruiz-Rojas, 
Acosta-Vargas, De-Moreta-Llovet, & Gonzalez-Rodriguez, 2023).
In an ESL classroom at a Malaysian public university, Chat GPT acts 
as a virtual teacher, offering assistance by providing outlines for speech 
drafts, editing and revising students’ work, and engaging in conversa-
tions on a variety of topics. Based on both qualitative and quantitative 
data, the findings revealed that Chat GPT was significantly effective in 
creating a learning environment to enhance students’ confidence and 
speaking skills in flipped classroom settings (Muniandy & Selvanathan, 
2024).
4.5.1.4. Teacher education and training. Chat GPT contributes to more 
equitable, open and accessible teacher education opportunities. It can 
provide materials and support mechanisms, previously available only to 
the privileged and economically well-off, to all teachers and student 
teachers. Different models can be integrated in AI-enhanced teacher 
training programs to provide customized teaching strategies and tools, 
enhancing teachers’ teaching without compromising fundamental 
educational values (van den Berg & du Plessis, 2023). While using 
Chat GPT, teachers are supposed to be cautious in evaluating and 
critiquing both the existing and generated materials, developing critical 
thinking and problem-solving skills.
Based on a survey on 216 college teachers, Lan (2024) conceptual-
ized three AI-enhanced teacher training models in which Chat GPT 
promotes teachers’ career development as a navigator, collaborator and 
inventor. Teacher training programs should combine the three models to 
provide diverse teaching strategies and instruments by organizing dis-
cussion groups to solve practical cases, simulating teaching environ-
ments, providing instant feedback and encouraging creative project 
design with the help of new technologies.
4.5.2. Chat GPT as a learning assistant
4.5.2.1. Personalized learning experience. Chat GPT can be leveraged to 
provide personalized learning experiences by adapting its responses to 
individual students’ needs, interests, and learning styles. This can help 
tailor the educational content to better suit each student’s unique 
learning process. In language studies, Chat GPT can personalize language 
learning and improve students’ productivity by providing learning

materials, improving writing skills and serving as a conversational 
partner (Nugroho, Putro, & Syamsi, 2023). Chat GPT can potentially 
benefit international students by providing personalized and adaptive 
learning opportunities. For example, language translation services can 
be produced to help to mitigate the cultural and language barriers faced 
by international students (T. Wang et al., 2023). In music education, 
Chat GPT was utilized to customize learning material to correspond with 
the distinct learning objectives and musical preference of individual 
students. The results of the educational experiment revealed that the 
experimental group exhibited a higher level of musical knowledge 
acquisition in comparison to the control group, indicating Chat GPT’s 
noteworthy effectiveness for enhancing student’s music learning abili-
ties (Zhou & Kim, 2024).
4.5.2.2. Critical thinking skills development. By engaging in discussions 
with Chat GPT, students can develop their critical thinking and problem- 
solving skills. The model’s ability to generate multiple perspectives and 
potential solutions can encourage students to think more creatively and 
critically (Suriano, Plebe, Acciai, & Fabio, 2025). In reverse, critically 
embracing Chat GPT-generated solutions helped students develop 
meta-cognition and critical thinking ability in reverse (Exintaris, Kar-
unaratne, & Yuriev, 2023).
In an introductory chemistry class, practices were implemented to 
specifically target the enhancement of critical thinking skills. The find-
ings revealed notable improvement in students’ awareness of their 
critical thinking competence, with an increase from an initial 46% to a 
postactivity 67% students associating their use of Chat GPT with an 
amplified sense of self-efficacy in the application of critical thinking 
skills (Guo & Lee, 2023). In a study that evaluated the impact of 
Chat GPT on critical thinking skills among 392 medical students in Saudi 
Arabia, the majority of participants (92.6%) believed that incorporating 
Chat GPT would enhance critical thinking, with 174 strongly recognizing 
its positive influence. The research concluded that integrating Chat GPT 
into medical education had potential to foster critical thinking abilities 
(Almazrou et al., 2024).
4.5.2.3. Motivation enhancement. Chat GPT holds potential in promoting 
students’ learning motivation to learn. More positive characteristics of 
motivation are detected in Chat GPT-based education than negative ones 
due to the conversational and social nature of chatbots (Hmoud et al., 
2024). In EAL learning, a Multidimensional Approach Culture, Humor, 
and Empathy Bot (MACHE-Bot) leveraged AI to generate culturally 
relevant humor and empathy, thereby enhancing learner’s learning 
outcomes and overall well-being. Five essential factors collectively 
contributed to the positive learning experiences: intercultural 
dimensions, user trust, anthropomorphism, reciprocal self-disclosure 
and higher engagement and motivation (Zhai, Wibowo, & Li, 2024). 
In Al-powered math class, students reported positive learning experi-
ences with Chat GPT, with mean scores for perceived usefulness in 
comprehending mathematical concepts, problem-solving confidence, 
and explaining thought processes all exceeding 3.5 on a 5-point scale, 
which contributes to the enhancement of students’ self-efficacy belief 
(Canonigo, 2024).
4.5.2.4. Career and mental health support. Chat GPT can provide 
personalized career guidance and job selection by helping students 
identify their strengths, interests, aptitudes, abilities and goals 
(Alqahtani et al., 2023). The career decision-making can be facilitated 
with the tailored advice on potential career paths. Chat GPT and other 
AI-powered tools also offers solutions to mental health problems among 
college students with their NLP capability (Alqahtani et al., 2023). This 
technology create a safe and non-judgmental environment for students 
to confide their emotions, and assist in the early identification of mental 
health. For instance, a research found that Chat GPT was considered a 
potential and reliable tool for educators and students interested in the 
topic of sexual consent. It consistently offered detailed insights on sexual 
consent when responding to various questions. Meanwhile it effectively 
provided examples of consent, including both verbal and nonverbal cues 
and the influence of substances (Marcantonio et al., 2023).
4.5.3. Chat GPT as a research assistant
4.5.3.1. Academic writing support. The role of AI as a research assistant 
was quite acceptable among researchers and editors. Its powerful text- 
generating capability has been notably displayed in facilitating au-
thors in academic writing through text generation, data analysis, results 
interpretation, literature review, formatting and editing, and peer re-
view (Alqahtani et al., 2023; Crawford, Cowling, & Allen, 2023; De 
Paoli, 2023), revolutionizing the way education and research occur. The 
integration of AI assistance in the academia area would ease the burden 
of both academics and students during the writing process and help 
improving the quality of academic papers (Kamal & Khaidzir, 2024).
A recent survey delved into Chinese medical students’ experience in 
using Chat GPT to write English academic writing. Feedback from the 
questionnaire revealed that 92% students reported an improvement in 
the quality of their writing, 84% noted progress in their language skills, 
and 76% recognized the contribution of Chat GPT in supporting aca-
demic research. These positive results highlighted the effectiveness of 
large language models in augmenting the English academic writing 
proficiency of non-native speakers in medical education (J. Li et al., 
Fig. 3. Chat GPT’s applications and effectiveness for teachers, students and researchers.

2024).
4.5.3.2. Library service. Chat GPT is believed to hold potential to assist 
researchers and facilitate librarian’s work by providing quick and effi-
cient libraries’ services (Nehra & Bansode, 2024). An AI-powered 
chatbot integrated into the library’s system can be used to provide 
recommendations for books or other references, which enables librar-
ians to focus on more complex tasks and allow them to provide better 
service (Houston & Corrado, 2023). A real case is that a chatbot named 
Aisha in Zayed University Library of United Arab Emirates was designed 
to provide such services to students and faculty outside the regular 
working hours, leading to a more accessible and convenient user expe-
rience. Adding additional features like speech-to-text or text-speech 
transformation, it can possibly enhance the accessibility and visibility 
for individuals with impairments (Lappalainen & Narayanan, 2023).
4.5.3.3. Research supervision. Chat GPT’s capabilities can be leveraged 
to enhance undergraduate and postgraduate research supervision. On 
the one hand, Chat GPT could support research by providing construc-
tive feedback for students prior to submitting draft to supervisory teams, 
which may promote student psychological need fulfilment, autonomy, 
competence and relatedness(Cowling, Crawford, Allen, & Wehmeyer, 
2023). On the other hand, Chat GPT has an impact on the evolution of 
postgraduate supervisory relationship. AI tools used in research activ-
ities play a role in shaping an enhanced supervision model, in which the 
teachers provide more high-level guidance and personalized feedback, 
leaving the postgraduate students more autonomy and independence in 
self-directed researches (Dai, Lai, Lim, & Liu, 2023).
4.6. Performance of Chat GPT across different disciplines(RQ6)
Empirical studies revealed that Chat GPT’s performance varied 
significantly across disciplines, which can be reflected by the numbers of 
publications across difference subjects as shown in Table 4.
In the field of humanities and social sciences, the performance of 
Chat GPT was found to be affected by the complexity of the subject itself 
and the question types. When required to take college entrance exams, 
Chat GPT achieved excellent accuracy rates in subjects like history, 
economy and psychology, but performed poorly in linguistics, with 
linguistic 
complexity 
being 
a 
major 
contributing 
factor 
(Beltozar-Clemente, Diaz-Vega, Tejeda-Navarrete, & Zapata-Paulini, 
2024). It was also found that in solving economics-related questions, 
AI tools achieved better results in numerical questions. However, their 
capabilities notably declines at the higher levels of the Bloom’s taxon-
omy, such as “analyze”, “evaluate” and “create” (Thanh et al., 2023).
In the field of medicine, one of the major Chat GPT-assisted areas, we 
synthesized the findings of nine empirical studies in which Chat GPT 
competed with medical students in sitting for standardized tests 
featuring multiple choice questions. With regard to subjects like peri-
odontology, Otorhinolaryngology, obstetrics and gynecology, Chat GPT 
outperformed human candidates with above-average scores, but misin-
formation was occasionally observable (Danesh, Pazouki, Danesh, 
Danesh, & Vardar-Sengul, 2024; Li et al., 2023; Long et al., 2024). For 
the rest of the studies, Chat GPT failed to reach the average score of 
students or didn’t even pass the overall pass mark (Cuthbert & Simpson, 
2023; Saad, Iyengar, Kurisunkal, & Botchu, 2023; Sallam & Al-Salahat, 
2023; Sarangi et al., 2023; Surapaneni et al., 2023; X. Wang et al., 2023). 
Therefore, Chat GPT can not replace professional doctors for the time 
being. When using it as a tool in clinical practice, students and clinicians 
should exert caution and be aware of its fallibility (Cuthbert & Simpson, 
2023).
In the field of computing, we extracted five studies in which Chat GPT 
was used for programming courses. Chat GPT performed well in assess-
ing student programming homework (Popovici, 2023), but it was un-
satisfactory in sitting programming exams, merely comparable to a 
mid-range student (Ellis, Casey, & Hill, 2024; Popovici, 2023). It was 
unable to pass the assessments (Savelka, Agarwal, An, Bogart, & Sakr, 
2023; Savelka, Agarwal, Bogart, Song, & Sakr, 2023) and unable to give 
the best solution in terms of object-oriented design (Cipriano & Alves, 
2023). These findings indicates that Chat GPT could only assist teachers 
and students in the introductory or intermediate stage of computing 
courses due to its current insufficiency.
In conclusion, Chat GPT performed better in questions requiring low- 
level abilities than those requiring high-level thinking skills, regardless 
of humanities or scientific questions. Although it has demonstrated 
better performance than Chat GPT 3.5 in many studies (Danesh et al., 
2024; Saad et al., 2023; Thanh et al., 2023), Chat GPT-4.0 still has sig-
nificant potential for improvement in producing more accurate and 
pertinent content through deep learning techniques.
4.7. Adoption and acceptance of Chat GPT in higher education(RQ7)
From the three grouped clusters identified by Cit Net Explorer, we 
selected the largest one and drilled down the longest paths, which led to 
Davis and Davis (1989) and Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, and Davis 
(2003)—creators of the Technology Acceptance Model(TAM) and the 
Unified Theories of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) 
respectively—as the highest nodes. Major findings will be discussed 
according to the citation networks.
4.7.1. Evolution of TAM and its development
The original TAM model was grounded in the field of psychology 
with only three basic factors, namely perceived usefulness, perceived 
ease of use and attitude (Davis, F. D.,1986). Among the three de-
terminants, attitude is considered dominant on the user’s actual use and 
is influence by the other two constructs. This theory manifested itself in 
a research aiming to predict doctoral students’ behavioral intention to 
use Chat GPT for writing (Zou & Huang, 2023) (see Fig. 4).
By incorporating external predictors, factors from other theories, 
contextual factors and usage measures, the extended TAM models were 
enabled to make more valid predictions to better understand the de-
terminants of the technology acceptance (Maranguni´c & Grani´c, 2015). 
Rahman, Sabbir, Zhang, Moral, and Hossain (2023) added two 
less-explored constructs, perceived enjoyment and perceived informa-
tiveness, and believed that trust mediated the relationship between 
perceived enjoyment and attitude. Duong, Vu, and Ngo (2023) found 
that effort expectancy and knowledge sharing had a direct impact on 
student actual use of Chat GPT.
Abdaljaleel et al. (2024) further developed the model into a 
“TAME-Chat GPT” instrument specifically designed to evaluate the 
adoption of Chat GPT. Their results highlighted the collective influence 
of these factors on the successful integration of Chat GPT in higher ed-
ucation, including perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, positive

attitude towards technology, social influence, behavioral/cognitive el-
ements, low anxiety, and minimal perceived risks.
4.7.2. Evolution of UTAUT and it extensions
The earliest UTAUT framework focused on six major variables and 
their interplay, namely performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy 
(EE), social influence (SI), facilitating conditions (FC), behavioral 
intention (BI), and usage behaviour (UB) (Venkatesh et al., 2003). 
Duong, Bui, Pham, Vu, and Nguyen (2023) explored the impact of EE 
and PE on college students’ intentions and actual uses of Chat GPT and 
concluded that their impact was positive but it will be lowered when 
there is an inconsistency between EE and PE (see Fig. 5).
With the development of modern technology and the increasing 
demand for a better examining instrument, the original UTAUT was 
extended into UTAUT 2 with the incorporation of three new constructs 
as hedonic motivation (HM), price value (PV), and habit (HA) and three 
moderators as age, gender and experience (Tamilmani, Rana, Wamba, & 
Dwivedi, 2021). It turned out that findings were consistent across 
studies framed with UTAUT2, revealing that performance expectancy, 
effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, price value, 
habit all exert significant influence on students’ behavioral intention to 
use Chat GPT, while facilitating conditions, habit, and behavioral 
intention act as primary drivers of usage behaviour (Foroughi et al., 
2023; Nawaz et al., 2024; Romero-Rodriguez, Ramirez-Montoya, Bue-
nestado-Fernandez, & Lara-Lara, 2023; Salifu, Arthur, Arkorful, Nortey, 
& Osei-Yaw, 2024; Strzelecki, 2023; Strzelecki & El Arabawy, 2024).
Meta-UTAUT is another modified version of UTAUT which holds that 
attitude was the central mediator to behavioral intentions and usage 
behaviours (Dwivedi, Rana, Jeyaraj, Clement, & Williams, 2019). In an 
empirical studies examining Dutch college students’ acceptance of 
Chat GPT, it was revealed that attitude and behavioral intention acted as 
positive predictors of usage behaviour, and anthropomorphism, design 
novelty, trust, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy were 
positive antecedents of attitude (Polyportis & Pahos, 2024).
Despite the continuous evolution and advancement of the UTAUT 
model, some researchers preferred to adapt the models according to 
their specific survey needs by introducing new variables. For instance, 
Hidayat-ur-Rehman and Ibrahim (2023) employed an integrated “Edu-
cator’s Adoption of Chat GPT” model based on the theoretical frame-
works of UTAUT and Status Quo Bias. Jo (2023)
present a 
comprehensive model including 13 uncommon variables to understand 
user engagement with Chat GPT. These studies provided more compre-
hensive insights concerning the interplay between factors influencing 
the adoption and acceptance of Chat GPT.
5. Discussion
5.1. Potential benefits to higher education
The advantages of Chat GPT can be fully unleashed when it em-
powers higher education by acting as teaching, learning and research 
assistants in ways as mentioned in section 4.5, bringing numerous 
benefits to the field of higher education. As a conversational chatbot, 
based on its core technique—the generative pre-trained (GPT) model—it 
is capable of understanding linguistic logic, processing natural lan-
guages, and constantly adjusting and improving itself based on user 
inputs, thus excelling over other AI tools in producing real-time and 
personalized responses (Farrokhnia, Banihashem, Noroozi, & Wals, 
2023).
Although researchers appeal for caution, guidance and supervisions 
for those who wish to incorporate this powerful tool (van den Berg & du 
Plessis, 2023; West et al., 2023), the incorporation of Chat GPT into 
higher education is believed to level the playing field for all people by 
opening access to teaching materials and supporting mechanisms (van 
den Berg & du Plessis, 2023b).
5.2. Limitations in educational practice
The remarkable capabilities of Chat GPT are sometimes over-
shadowed by its deficiencies in content generation, such as inaccuracy, 
inconsistency and hallucination. For instance, the AI generated contents 
required too much human prompting and editing and tended to be 
generic (Meron & Araci, 2023). In designing exams, Chat GPT compiled 
and matched questions for students of different levels with limited va-
riety and accuracy (Niu & Xue, 2023). In assisting college Physics 
teacher’s teaching, Chat GPT lacked comprehensive knowledge and 
adequate training (Podlasov & Matviichuk, 2023).
There is also a danger for learners to completely trust Chat GPT 
without checking the authenticity of the generated texts and thus 
negatively affect the acquisition of knowledge and skills (Kiryakova & 
Angelova, 2023). Additionally, students might possibly become overly 
dependent on Chat GPT for their daily tasks, which may be detrimental 
to the cultivation of advanced thinking skills essential for their 
long-term study and career development (Putra, Rangka, Aminah, & 
Aditama, 2023). All these limitations and risks in some ways can be 
destructive, posing a threat to the overall quality of higher education.
5.3. Ethical and legal risks
One of the reasons why the academia remains cautious about the 
application of Chat GPT in higher education derives from the concern 
over potential violations of academic integrity, especially those associ-
ated with academic dishonesty and plagiarism in the field of academic 
research and publication (Cotton, Cotton, & Shipway, 2023; Crawford, 
Cowling, & Allen, 2023; Jarrah, Wardat, & Fidalgo, 2023).
The legal problems resulting from use of Chat GPT is equally alarm-
ing. Chat GPT and other AI models can give rise to legal risks by pro-
ducing offensive or copyrighted content, impingement of privacy, 
fraudulent transactions and spreading false information (Dwivedi et al., 
2023) Biased or discriminated information may be produced when there 
is intrinsic bias in AI algorithms itself, perpetuating existing educational 
inequalities (Alqahtani et al., 2023).
Lastly, the release of Chat GPT has sparkled a renewed debate on the 
impact of disruptive technologies on human jobs and labor market 
(Dianova & Schultz, 2023). With the development of Generative AI 
technology, there is an increasingly alarming tendency that AI will 
gradually replace the roles of teachers or compete with college students 
in the already competitive job markets.

5.4. Mitigation strategies
5.4.1. Cultivation of AI literacy
Since its debut in educational stage, Chat GPT has been seen as a 
double-edged sword, bring astonishing potentials and unavoidable is-
sues at the same time. In order to improve the effectiveness of Chat GPT 
and foster a positive AI-powered educational environment, the academic 
community calls for the establishment of a comprehensive framework of 
AI literacy which originates from the concepts of data literacy or digital 
literacy (Chan & Lee, 2023; Dianova & Schultz, 2023; S. Lee & Park, 
2024; Sperling et al., 2024).
Lee and Park (2024) highlighted the importance of measuring users’ 
digital literacy in fostering a healthy digital ecosystem and introduced a 
framework for AI literacy with five essential factors: technical profi-
ciency, critical evaluation, communication proficiency, creative appli-
cation and ethical competence. Farrelly and Baker (2023) proposed an 
AI literacy framework with three basic components: to acquire an un-
derstanding of the basic concept of AI, to use AI concepts for evaluation 
and to use AI concepts for understanding the world through problem 
solving. In the future, AI literacy is not only a technical expertise but 
rather a holistic understanding that aligns with humanistic values and 
ethical considerations (Tzirides et al., 2024).
For higher education institutions, they should focus on cultivating AI 
literacy to equip students with knowledge, skills and competencies in 
dealing with AI technology (Dai et al., 2023). Universities should teach 
students to understand the basics of how AI tools work, including their 
potential biases and risks (Alm & Watanabe, 2023). This can help stu-
dents develop a deeper understanding of AI and its potential impact on 
their field of study.
In practice, curriculum should combine practical knowledge about 
AI’s applications with hands-on experience with AI tools and techniques. 
Human efforts are indispensable in supporting students’ learning expe-
rience in AI-assisted educational context. With human teaching assistant 
and Chat GPT working collaboratively, the learning environment pro-
moted an active, hands-on instructional style, which is beneficial for 
teaching highly technical concepts(Pahi, Hawlader, Hicks, Zaman, & 
Phan, 2024).
Integrating information technology curriculum is also considered 
helpful for reducing technostress incurred by a lack of digital learning 
skills (Lin & Yu, 2024). Similarly, ethical topics such as data privacy, 
biased information, reliability of AI outputs, and steps to mitigate the 
risks from these implications should be integrated to ensure responsible 
use of AI (Tzirides et al., 2024), which are crucial for fostering a critical 
and analytical mindset in students. A trans-disciplinary pedagogy was 
considered specifically necessary for university students’ AI literacy 
education. By bridging humanities with STEM subjects, digital human-
ities education will “promote responsible use of generative AI and 
encouraging critical reflection on AI’s socio-cultural embedded-
ness”(Dianova & Schultz, 2023).
It is equally important for higher institution to provide AI literacy 
training and support for faculty members, enabling them to use Chat GPT 
effectively and address the potential challenges and limitations of AI 
technologies. To achieve this, education scientists need to reach a 
broader consensus of what the theoretical knowledge of AI literacy 
regarding teacher education should entail. During this exploring process 
teachers need to be involved in to ensure a contextualized AI literacy in 
authentic teaching with ethical considerations (Sperling et al., 2024). In 
reverse, offering AI literacy education to teachers will help students 
become successful users and creators of AI. Hur (2024) noted that 
integrating hands-on activities into AI literacy education can foster 
preservice teachers’ confidence and positive attitudes toward using AI in 
education. Consequently, teachers’ understanding of AI can be useful to 
promote creativity and problem solving with AI among students. 
Collaborative, problem-solving and hands-on activities are significant 
for both teachers’ and students’ AI education.
5.4.2. Responsibilities of stakeholders
To address the shortcomings of Chat GPT and the ethical and risk 
considerations in its application within higher education, it is impera-
tive that collaborative efforts involving various stakeholders to be un-
dertaken to ensure the quality and equity of higher education. This 
collective approach will guide the development and implementation of 
AI technologies in a manner that is both pedagogically sound and ethi-
cally responsible.
AI inventors should prioritize the upgrading of AI products to ensure 
that they can effectively fulfill the role of a facilitator in actual educa-
tional scenarios. They should collaborate with educators to leverage AI 
technologies with specific goals to improve learning and teaching on a 
large scale (Zhang & Aslan, 2021). This involves not only refining the 
technology to better align with pedagogical goals but also addressing the 
ethical considerations and privacy concerns that arise with the inte-
gration of AI in education.
In academia, in view of the ethical concerns, editorial policies have 
been established by publishers to regulate the use of Chat GPT in aca-
demic writing, with a central principle being Chat GPT is not entitled to 
any real authorship (Crawford, Cowling, Ashton-Hay, et al., 2023; 
Lodge, Thompson, & Corrin, 2023; Rahimi & Abadi, 2023). The 
academia is supposed to delve deeper into this subject, striving to come 
up with additional solutions to tackle critical challenges associated with 
AI-assisted academic research. This includes addressing ethical concerns 
such as privacy issues, algorithmic bias, and academic dishonesty, 
thereby contributing to the responsible advancement of educational 
technology.
Policymakers need to make policies and take measures to ensure a 
legal and health environment for tech-assisted educational environ-
ment. For example, concrete measures could include developing and 
enforcing regulations that govern the use of AI-powered technology in 
education, providing fund and support for the development of AI- 
powered educational tools. Administrative stakeholders can facilitate 
workshops, seminars or informational sessions that highlight the bene-
fits of using AI for educational purposes (Jo, 2023). In addition, gov-
ernments can work with educational institutions to develop policies and 
guidelines for the integration of technology into the curriculum.
It is also imperative for all stakeholders to demystify Chat GPT to 
enhance people’s willingness to use this new technology. Since trust is a 
key factor for the users’ acceptance and adoption of AI (Polyportis & 
Pahos, 2024; Rahman et al., 2023), it’s vital for the marketers to deliver 
an approachable and non-intimidating user experience, thereby not 
overwhelming the users (Jo, 2023). To build an environment beneficial 
to user’s engagement, educators, AI designers and developers should 
aim to emphasize Chat GPT’s role as a supportive capabilities and foster 
more positive user attitudes towards AI.
In order to address all the challenges and limitations presented by 
Chat GPT, experts from different fields should collaboratively work on 
developing guidelines and best practices for the responsible use of 
Chat GPT, ensuring that it aligns with educational goals and students’ 
well-being. In such interdisciplinary efforts, both teachers and students 
can harness the full potential of Chat GPT to revolutionize higher edu-
cation while mitigating potential threats and risks.
6. Conclusion
6.1. Major findings
Since the emergence of Chat GPT in late 2022, the number of publi-
cations exploring Chat GPT-assisted higher education has surged up 
owing to its revolutionary impact on all aspects of higher education. It 
serves as a transformative tool for traditional teaching, learning and 
research practices. By leveraging its human-like text generation capa-
bilities, it has fostered a more interactive and efficient educational 
environment across different subjects. Models like TAM and UTAUT 
held their validity in predicting and examining the variables influencing 
T. Ma

users’ intention and usage of Chat GPT. Meanwhile, concerns about its 
limitations and potential threats to higher education have never 
stopped, urging people to take on measures to mitigate its risks while 
maximize its strengths.
6.2. Limitations
Despite the significant achievements of this literature review, we 
acknowledges its limitations. One is that we confined our research 
subject to Chat GPT, the most representative LLM. The inclusion of 
competitors like Google’s Bard or other Gen AI products in this review 
could alter the findings in several ways. Firstly, it would broaden the 
scope of the analysis to include a wider range of AI-powered tools and 
their capabilities. This could lead to the identification of additional 
strengths and weaknesses in Chat GPT compared to its competitors, 
revealing new opportunities and challenges for the use of AI in educa-
tion and research. Secondly, the inclusion of competitors could also 
affect the overall evaluation of Chat GPT’s performance, as the findings 
may now be relative to the performance of other similar products.
Another one is that this literature review has not conducted enough 
quantitative analysis to reveal deeper rationales of the superficial phe-
nomena. It would be more convincing to compare the performance of 
Chat GPT in different subjects if more experimental data or test results 
were provided. It is necessary for future research to consider a meta- 
analysis review by adopting more rigorous methods to conduct more 
in-depth analysis. Researchers could also analyze usage data to examine 
the impact of these tools on student learning outcome. This would 
provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of AI- 
powered tools in education and research.
6.3. Implications for future applications and research
In the future, applications and research should focus on exploring 
interdisciplinary collaboration to address the multifaceted challenges 
posed by Chat GPT as mentioned in this article. This includes addressing 
its inherent deficiencies, mitigating the ethical implications, and har-
nessing potential of Chat GPT to revolutionize teaching and learning 
practice.
Investigations into the perception and acceptance of AI technologies 
must continue, with a particular emphasis on understanding the dy-
namics of different determinants and their impacts on the usage of AI 
(Abdaljaleel et al., 2024; Amarathunga, 2024; Liu & Zhang, 2024). 
Research in this realm should carry out more empirical experiments that 
based on effective research methods, in an effort to examine student 
learning outcomes and offer insights into measures to enhance the 
integration of AI into higher education. Meanwhile, the adoption of 
Chat GPT should be analyzed in different disciplinary contexts to eluci-
date the nuances of how Chat GPT performance across various disci-
plines, which will help tailor educational applications to meet the 
specific needs and challenges of different academic fields.
As AI technologies advance, it is imperative that future applications 
and research delves into the follow-up evolutionary versions of Chat GPT 
and multimodal generative AI tools, such as AI-powered chatbot with 
complex human-computer interface, text-to-image and text-to-video AI 
tools and pedagogical agents (Amarathunga, 2024; Baker, Mills, 
Mcdonald, & Wang, 2023). By combining text, images, audio and video 
together, these AI tools can create more immersive, engaging and 
personalized learning environments for teachers and students.
The legal and ethical considerations concerning AI use in higher 
education must also be a priority (Amarathunga, 2024). Collaborative 
efforts among AI developers, educational institutions, and policymakers 
are essential to address these complex issues and shape the future of AI 
in higher education responsibly and effectively. Future research should 
provide insights into more practical methods in dealing with these 
issues.
