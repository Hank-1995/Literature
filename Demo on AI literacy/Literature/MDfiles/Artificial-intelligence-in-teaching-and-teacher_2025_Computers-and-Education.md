The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in education is increasingly recognized as a key driver of
educational innovation. While extensive literature exists on the integration of AI technologies in educational
settings, less emphasis has been placed on the critical role of teachers and their professional development needs.
This study systematically reviews research conducted between 2015 and 2024 on teachers’ use of AI technology
in their teaching and professional development, focusing on the relationship between the supply of professional
development opportunities and the demand for AI integration among teachers. Using PRISMA principles and
protocols, this review identified and synthesized 95 relevant research articles. The findings reveal a significant
imbalance in research focus. Specifically, 65% of the studies examined the application of AI in teaching,
including technologies such as conversational AI and related technologies, AI-driven learning and assessment
systems, immersive technologies, visual and auditory computing, and teaching and learning analytics. In
contrast, only 35% of the studies explored AI’s role in enhancing teacher professional development. This review
highlights a gap in research addressing the development needs of teachers as they integrate AI technologies into
their teaching practices. It emphasizes the need for future research to focus more on the potential of AI in teacher
professional development and to investigate how AI technologies can be applied in education from both the
perspectives of student learning and teacher instruction. Furthermore, research on AI in professional develop-
ment should prioritize addressing technological and ethical challenges to ensure the responsible and effective
integration of AI in education.
1. Introduction
Since 2022, generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies,
exemplified by Chat GPT, have rapidly matured and shown significant
potential in various downstream tasks (Bengesi et al., 2024; Lin et al.,
2022). These technological advancements have catalyzed a growing
interest in integrating earlier AI innovations from fields such as natural
language processing and computer vision into educational settings,
making AI in education a prominent research area (Lo, 2023; Mai et al.,
2024). Scholars have increasingly explored how these AI technologies
can enhance the teaching and learning process through tools such as
chatbots, AI-assisted learning platforms, data-driven decision support
systems, and learning behavior analysis tools, among others (Tang et al.,
2023; Zhang & Aslan, 2021) The potential for AI to revolutionize
teaching is being actively examined across the education sector.
However, this trend is not without controversy. Concerns have been
raised about the possibility of AI to diminish the role of teachers,
compromise educational quality, or adversely impact students’ cogni-
tive development (Chan & Tsi, 2023; Edwards & Cheok, 2018). Despite
these concerns, the academic community remains focused on exploring
the potential applications and benefits of AI tools in teaching practices.
Prior to the emergence of generative AI, the application of AI in
education was largely confined to supporting teaching and assessment
tasks, such as intelligent learning systems and automatic scoring tools
(Wang, 2021). For instance, Baker et al. (2019) highlighted the exten-
sive use of AI tools in education, emphasizing their service to three
primary stakeholder groups: learners, teachers, and educational ad-
ministrators. Intelligent learning systems, such as CENTURY, have been
beneficial for students, enabling self-paced learning and customizing
learning materials to align with individual interests. Similarly, intelli-
gent instructional management software, like Class Charts, has sup-
ported teachers by reducing administrative burdens, providing deeper
insights into student performance, and fostering innovative classroom
practices. Moreover, certain AI applications, such as supervised machine

learning-based school evaluation systems, have aided school adminis-
trators in decision-making and information management. While these
tools have enhanced teaching and learning processes, their functional-
ities and applications were relatively narrow in scope. Prior research
indicates that early AI systems were limited in their ability to assess
complex cognitive performance and generate personalized learning
content (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019).
With the rapid development of generative AI technologies, particu-
larly the emergence of the applications based on large language models
like Chat GPT, the field of education is witnessing unprecedented op-
portunities for innovation. These AI tools are not only adept at gener-
ating text and images but are also capable of handling complex tasks
such as programming and creative writing (Creely & Blannin, 2023;
Denny et al., 2024). This progress significantly expands the scope of AI
applications in education, offering enhanced flexibility and efficiency in
content creation and personalized learning pathway development. For
teachers, generative AI technologies not only enrich the learning expe-
rience but also increase teaching efficiency, enabling them to dedicate
more time to instructional innovation and student interaction (Kshetri,
2023).
In recent years, numerous scholars have extensively reviewed the
applications of AI technologies in the educational sector. Ng et al. (2023)
examined the evolution of AI in teaching and learning research from
2000 to 2020, highlighting the widespread adoption of AI tools in
university-level computer science education and noting a growing trend
toward integrating AI tools in K-12 education. They also observed a
global movement to incorporate AI literacy into educational standards.
Chiu et al. (2023) analyzed the opportunities, challenges, and future
research directions of AI in education, uncovering the multifaceted roles
and challenges of AI technologies across key educational domains
through an analysis of literature from the past decade. Crompton and
Burke (2023) focused on AI applications in higher education from 2016
to 2022, reporting a rapid increase in AI usage in education, particularly
in 2021 and 2022, with an expanding geographical distribution of
research efforts. Similarly, Zawacki-Richter et al. (2019) provided a
systematic review of AI applications in higher education, emphasizing
that the primary focus has been on academic support services and
institutional administration. Bozkurt et al. (2021) examined fifty years
of AI research in education, identifying key themes in AI technologies
while highlighting a significant research gap regarding ethical issues
related to AI in education.
Although the existing literature extensively explores the application
of AI technologies in education, most studies focus predominantly on
their direct impact on teaching processes, with comparatively less
attention given to the critical role of teachers and their professional
development needs. Several studies have identified a significant
mismatch between the AI technology training offered by educational
institutions and the practical needs of teachers (Chiu et al., 2023; Ng
et al., 2023; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019). Given the pivotal role of
teachers in educational activities, their proficiency in AI technologies is
crucial for ensuring high-quality instruction. Therefore, it is essential to
thoroughly examine how teachers utilize AI technologies in practice and
to bridge the gap between existing professional development pro-
grammes and the actual needs of teachers.
The purpose of this study is to review research conducted between
2015 and 2024 to develop a comprehensive understanding of teachers’
achievements in integrating AI technologies into their teaching and their
professional development within this context. Focusing on this time
period was a deliberate choice, as it captures a decade marked by rapid
advancements in AI and its transformative impact on education. The
year 2015 marked a pivotal moment in AI’s evolution, characterized by
the emergence of groundbreaking technologies—such as deep learning
and natural language processing—that renewed interest in applying AI
across educational contexts (Le Cun et al., 2015). This period also wit-
nessed a significant rise in AI-driven educational tools designed specif-
ically to support teacher training, professional development, and
instructional practices (Luckin et al., 2016).
Through a systematic review of literature published between 2015
and 2024, this study aims to examine the relationship between the
availability of professional development opportunities and the needs of
teachers in applying AI technologies in education. Additionally, it seeks
to provide actionable recommendations for effective teacher profes-
sional development programmes. The research questions (RQs) guiding
this study are as follows:
RQ1. What are the publication trends related to AI in teaching and
professional development published between January 2015 and July
2024, including the number of studies, geographical distribution,
disciplinary focus, educational levels, and types of AI technologies used?
RQ2. How do teachers integrate AI technologies into their teaching
practices at different educational levels and disciplinary focuses?
RQ3. What are the major research areas on teacher professional
development programmes aimed at supporting the integration of AI in
teaching practices?
RQ1 focuses on publication trends to provide a temporal and
contextual overview of the field, identifying periods of growth and shifts
in focus. This analysis is crucial for understanding the evolution of in-
terest in AI for teaching and teacher professional development, partic-
ularly in light of recent advancements in generative AI technologies. It
also highlights emerging areas and potential research gaps, offering a
foundation for further exploration. RQ2 examines how teachers inte-
grate AI technologies across different educational levels and disciplinary
focuses. By investigating this aspect, this question seeks to uncover
variations in the use of AI, which can inform the development of tailored
strategies for effective integration. Understanding these differences is
critical for designing professional development programmes that
address specific needs within diverse educational settings. RQ3 aims to
map the major research areas within this field, providing insights into
the thematic focus of existing studies. This analysis identifies predomi-
nant topics and methodologies, offering a structured overview to inform
future research directions and identify underexplored areas requiring
further investigation. Together, these research questions provide a
comprehensive framework for understanding the field, guiding both
practical applications and future research endeavors.
2. Method
This study follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Sys-
tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to systematically
address the research questions. PRISMA provides a standardized
framework for conducting systematic reviews, encompassing steps such
as literature searching, screening, data extraction, analysis, and
reporting (Page et al., 2021). The specific steps undertaken in this
research are: (1) conducting a comprehensive literature search based on
predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria; (2) performing two rounds
of screening to evaluate the eligibility of the identified studies; (3)
extracting key information from the selected studies and organizing it
into structured tables; (4) analyzing the extracted data in detail to
address the research questions; and (5) preparing the research report in
alignment with PRISMA standards.
2.1. Search strategy
This research focuses on literature related to teachers’ integration of
AI technologies into their teaching practices and professional develop-
ment. To address the research questions, a search strategy was devel-
oped to target articles published between January 1, 2015, and July 30,
2024. The initial step involved identifying core keywords, including
“artificial intelligence” and “teachers”. A preliminary review of search
results was then conducted to refine and expand the keywords to ensure
comprehensive coverage. This process resulted in the inclusion of AI-
related terms (“artificial intelligence”, “AI”, “Chat GPT”, “GAI”, and
“Generative AI”) and terms related to teaching and professional

development (“teaching”, “teacher training”, and “teacher professional
development”). The search was applied to titles, keywords, and abstracts
of articles containing at least one AI-related term and one term related to
teaching and professional development. The literature search was con-
ducted using two major databases: Scopus and Web of Science (Wo S),
recognized for their extensive coverage of high-quality journals across
various disciplines, including education and artificial intelligence (Tang
et al., 2023; Zhang & Aslan, 2021). These databases were selected due to
their reputation as the most reliable sources for citation indexing in
evidence-based scientific research (Ng et al., 2023).
The initial search results yielded 5623 articles: 792 from Scopus and
4831 from Wo S. To ensure quality, only peer-reviewed journal articles
were included. This approach aligns with the perspectives of Hwang
et al. (2021) and Tang et al. (2023), who suggest that systematic reviews
focusing on high-quality journal articles are more likely to reveal
meaningful research trends. Non-empirical papers and conference pa-
pers were excluded due to their lack of rigorous research design and
reproducibility (Booth et al., 2021). This selection critiera is consistent
with established systematic review guidelines, which recommend
prioritizing sources with verified rigor to enhance the validity of find-
ings (Page et al., 2021). After applying predefined inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria (see Fig. 1), the initial pool was reduced to 2373 articles for
detailed screening.
2.2. Screening
The screening process was conducted manually with meticulous
attention to detail. First, duplicate articles were identified and removed
by screening for duplicate titles and authors, resulting in the exclusion of
485 publications. Second, the titles and abstracts of the remaining ar-
ticles were reviewed against the predefined inclusion and exclusion
criteria (see Fig. 1). The step ensured that only empirical studies related
to teachers’ integration of AI technologies into their teaching practices
and professional development were included. As a result, 1696 articles
were excluded for being irrelevant or falling into excluded categories
such as conceptual papers, literature reviews, commentaries, conference
papers, and other non-empirical research. Third, during the manual
screening process, 23 articles were excluded due to the unavailability of
full text. Following this, a thorough review of the full texts of eligible
studies led to the exclusion of 74 additional articles that did not meet the
inclusion criteria. A total of 2278 articles were excluded after screening.
Ultimately, 95 articles were deemed eligible and included in this sys-
tematic review.
2.3. Coding
As outlined in the research questions, this study aims to examine how
teachers apply AI technologies in their teaching practices and their
professional development. To achieve these objectives, a combination of
deductive and inductive coding methods was employed to systemati-
cally analyze the 95 selected articles.
To ensure the validity and reliability of the coding process, this study
utilized predefined codes to categorize information based on the theo-
retical framework and coding methods referenced in prior research

(Bozkurt et al., 2021; Crompton & Burke, 2023; Ng et al., 2023).
Deductive coding was applied during the initial stage to extract and
record specific information from the articles, including author affilia-
tions, geographical locations, research fields, and publication years,
based on data from the Scopus and Wo S databases. Predefined codes
were also employed to classify disciplines (e.g., English language,
mathematics, science) and educational levels (e.g., higher education,
K-12 education).
During the inductive coding phase, grounded theory coding tech-
niques (Strauss & Corbin, 1994) were employed to identify emergent
themes related to AI development trends and teaching applications as
reflected in the literature. "In vivo" coding (Salda˜na, 2021) was utilized
to extract language directly from the texts, ensuring that the codes
remained closely aligned with the original authors’ findings. To ensure
reliability, a multi-round iterative coding process was implemented,
enabling continuous comparison and refinement of codes. Initial codes
were systematically developed into axial codes (Strauss & Corbin, 1994)
to establish meaningful connections between themes.
This iterative approach was further complemented by an intercoder
reliability process to enhance the robustness of the analysis. Two inde-
pendent researchers with expertise in the field coded the articles sepa-
rately and then compared and refined their results to assess consistency.
Cohen’s Kappa was employed to quantify intercoder agreement,
yielding a value of 0.85, which indicates strong agreement (Mc Hugh,
2012). Any discrepancies between the coders were discussed and
resolved to reach consensus.
These steps ensured both the validity and reliability of the coding
process. As a result of this systematic approach, the coded data was
organized into two main categories: “AI in teaching” and “AI in pro-
fessional development”. For “AI in teaching”, articles were grouped
based on their focus on AI applications in teaching. This category was
further refined through deductive coding to classify studies by educa-
tional levels, subject disciplines, and types of AI technologies used. For
“AI in professional development”, articles were grouped based on their
examination of teacher professional development in using AI technolo-
gies. Inductive coding was then applied to identify specific professional
development purposes, while also categorizing the various AI technol-
ogies employed in these studies.
3. Results
We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the 95 articles to sys-
tematically examine publication trends, including the number of studies,
geographical distribution, disciplinary focus, educational levels, and
types of AI technologies used. The analysis focused on teachers’ use of AI
technologies and the considerations for professional development in
supporting the application of these technologies. Following the analysis,
five sub-categories were identified under "AI in teaching", and four sub-
categories were identified under "AI in professional development". For
each sub-category, we applied axial coding to integrate two secondary
codes—discipline and educational level—derived from the deductive
coding process.
3.1. RQ1: what are the publication trends related to AI in teaching and
professional development published between January 2015 and July 2024,
including the number of studies, geographical distribution, disciplinary
focus, educational levels, and types of AI technologies used?
3.1.1. Number of studies
The literature search for this study spanned from January 1, 2015 to
July 31, 2024. Research focusing on the application of AI in teaching
from the teacher’s perspective, as well as studies on teacher professional
development in using AI, began to gain momentum in 2019. A notable
surge in publications occurred starting in 2022, reflecting increased
scholarly attention to this area (see Fig. 2).
3.1.2. Geographical distribution
The geographical distribution of included studies was analyzed
based on the institutional affiliation of the first author. Among the 95
articles, researchers were affiliated with institutions in 30 different
countries or regions (see Fig. 3). The majority of studies were conducted
by researchers based in the United States and China.
3.1.3. Disciplinary focus
During the deductive coding phase, the 95 articles were categorized
into 15 disciplinary areas according to the subjects addressed in the
research (see Fig. 4). In the “AI in teaching” category, the primary focus
was on AI applications in English language, computer science, arts,
mathematics, science and education. Meanwhile, in the “AI in profes-
sional
development”
category,
English
language
and
education
remained prominent areas, while many studies taking a multidisci-
plinary approach to enhance teachers’ AI literacy and competency
across various subjects.
3.1.4. Educational levels
During the deductive coding phase, the 95 articles were categorized
into eight educational levels based on the target population of the
research (see Fig. 5). The majority of studies focused on higher educa-
tion, followed by research targeting secondary education and then pri-
mary education. It is noteworthy that the application of generative AI in
special education has also emerged as an area of growing interest.
3.1.5. Types of AI technologies used
A review of the 95 articles identified four distinct types of AI tech-
nologies employed in the studies (see Fig. 6). Among the articles
focusing on AI in professional development, 17 did not specify the AI
technology used and were categorized as “not mentioned”. Notably,
conversational AI technologies, particularly chatbots, have emerged as
the most frequently utilized, with many studies exploring how chatbots,
such as Chat GPT, could facilitate teaching and learning processes.
3.2. RQ2: How do teachers integrate AI technologies into their teaching
practices at different educational levels and disciplinary focuses?
A total of 62 studies explored how teachers integrate various AI
technologies in their teaching practices. These technologies are cate-
gorized into conversational AI and related technologies, AI-driven
learning and assessment systems, immersive technologies, visual and
auditory computing, and teaching and learning analytics. This section
provides an overview of how teachers utilized these technologies across
different educational levels and disciplinary focuses, organized by the
specific types of AI technologies.
3.2.1. Conversational AI and related technologies
The integration of conversational AI and related technologies, such

as natural language processing techniques and chatbot technologies,
into teaching practices across different educational levels was examined
in 38 studies: 8 focused on K-12 education, 24 on higher education, and
6 on other educational contexts. With advancements in generative AI,
the use of conversational AI and related technologies in education has
become increasingly diverse. This diversity is depicted in the treemap in
Fig. 7, where each rectangle represents a specific category of use, with
its size proportional to the frequency of representation across various
studies. Conversational AI and related technologies play dual roles in
education. On one hand, they assist teachers by delivering personalized
learning experiences and real-time feedback to students, thereby
enhancing student engagement and improving academic performance.
On the other hand, they support teachers by improving teaching effi-
ciency through automating tasks such as curriculum design, test ques-
tion generation, and student assignment evaluation.
3.2.1.1. Higher education. The application of conversational AI and
related technologies in teaching practices has been extensively explored
in higher education, with 24 studies across various disciplines, including
STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), education,
languages (e.g., Chinese and English), and other fields.
3.2.1.1.1. STEM. In the field of STEM, seven studies focused on the
pedagogical application of conversational AI and related technologies.
For example, Lu et al. (2021) explored the potential of emerging AI
technologies, particularly natural language processing (NLP), for auto-
matic generation of short-answer questions. Demszky et al. (2023)
developed an NLP-based tool, M-Powering Teachers, to give automated
feedback aimed at enhancing instructors’ uptake of student contribu-
tions, thereby improving students’ course satisfaction.

Recognizing the conversational content generation capabilities of
chatbots like Chat GPT, five studies explored their applications in
teaching practices. Jukiewicz (2024) examined the role of Chat GPT in
automating scoring and feedback, indicating a strong positive correla-
tion with human teacher evaluations. Rahman and Watanobe (2023)
demonstrated Chat GPT’s supportive role in programming education,
reporting high student satisfaction while highlighting potential chal-
lenges such as bias, academic integrity concerns, and over-reliance on
the technology.
Additionally, Tassoti (2024) introduced the “Five S” prompt frame-
work to assist students in refining their prompts for chemistry-related
questions, resulting in higher student satisfaction with AI-generated
responses from a Discord chatbot powered by Chat GPT. Jia et al.
(2024) compared tips for geometry and algebra problems generated by
Chat GPT with those created by human tutors using the Turing test. Their
findings revealed that most human evaluators struggled to distinguish
between human- and AI-generated tips, suggesting that Chat GPT can
support educators by reducing the effort involved in designing mathe-
matical tips. Bai et al. (2024) proposed a three-step process for prompt
engineering to facilitate scenario-based learning with Chat GPT, leading
to increased intrinsic motivation, improved learning performance, and
more positive attitudes towards coding and computational thinking
among students.
3.2.1.1.2. Education. In the field of education, six studies explored
the use of chatbots to support teaching practices. Among these, four
focused on utilizing chatbots to guide students in developing conceptual
understanding across various educational contexts. Fidan and Gencel
(2022) examined the impact of integrating AI chatbots and peer feed-
back mechanisms into educational videos as tools for pre-service
teachers, focusing on their effects on learning performance and
intrinsic motivation in online learning environments. Their findings
revealed that, compared to traditional learning methods, groups utiliz-
ing chatbots and peer feedback achieved higher learning performance
and greater intrinsic motivation. This suggests that AI-driven feedback
mechanisms can be effective teaching tools in online education.
Mc Leod and Richardson (2023) shared their experiences using
Chat GPT as a teaching tool for digital technologies in an initial teacher
education programme at an Australian university. They highlighted how
students and educators used Chat GPT to co-construct technological
knowledge, emphasizing the importance of explicit instruction and
playful experimentation with the tool. Similarly, Li (2023) proposed a
Chat GPT-based flipped learning guidance approach (Chat GPT-FLGA),
highlighting Chat GPT’s role in providing scaffolding and assistance to
students. Compared to the traditional flipped learning guidance
approach, the Chat GPT-supported approach significantly enhanced
students’ performance, self-efficacy, learning attitudes, intrinsic moti-
vation, and creative thinking in course projects. These findings provide
empirical evidence supporting the integration of AI in flipped classroom
settings.
Ossa and Willatt (2023) introduced generative AI as a feedback tool
for students at a teacher education institute in Chile. They developed the
RECa P-GPT process, utilizing Chat GPT to provide feedback on students’
responses to educational case studies. Their study demonstrated the
potential of generative AI to deliver formative, large-scale feedback on
students’ written assignments efficiently and within a short time frame.
Other studies examined the use of chatbots to assist teachers in
instructional design and enhance their teaching performance. Davis and
Lee (2024) conducted a case study exploring the feasibility of using
Chat GPT in educational research, particularly its application in gener-
ating teaching plans. Their findings revealed that while Chat GPT was
capable of producing coherent and relevant curriculum topics and
subtopics, it faced limitations in integrating prior course content with
current learning experiences and in strategically preparing for future
learning outcomes. Lee and Zhai (2024) investigated how pre-service
elementary school teachers integrated Chat GPT into science learning
activities as part of lesson design at a university in South Korea. Using a
modified TPACK-based scoring criterion, the study evaluated lesson
plans and found that the pre-service teachers demonstrated a reasonable
understanding of incorporating Chat GPT into lesson design. This
included developing teaching strategies such as using Chat GPT to pro-
vide additional information, support role-playing activities, deliver
adaptive instruction, and facilitate feedback and reflection.
3.2.1.1.3. Language. Chatbot technologies, such as Chat GPT, have
made significant advancements in language understanding and gener-
ation. In recent years, their application in language education has
garnered considerable attention, particularly for their potential to
enhance language acquisition, enrich learning experience, support
assessment and reduce anxiety. Nine studies have investigated this po-
tential. For example, Boudouaia et al. (2024) explored the innovative
use of Chat GPT in teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing.
Students used Chat GPT to identify and rectify errors in their writing and
to revise their assignments based on the feedback provided. The study

Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence 8 (2025) 100355

found that Chat GPT significantly enhanced students’ English as a
Foreign Language (EFL) writing skills, which contributed to their aca-
demic success. Sasaki et al. (2024) examined the use of machine trans-
lation (MT) technology in writing instruction by comparing two types of
written feedback: comprehensive direct Teacher Corrective Feedback
(TCF) and MT-based feedback, in which Japanese text was translated
into English. Their analysis showed that TCF was more effective in
improving linguistic complexity, while MT-based feedback better
enhanced accuracy and fluency. Additionally, participants reported
feeling more positive and significantly more motivated when receiving
TCF compared to MT-based feedback.
Similarly, Kemelbekova et al. (2024) examined the impact of a
chatbot-driven AI system on improving students’ oral skills and overall
learning experience. Their findings suggest that the integration of AI in
teaching English as a second language can make a substantial contri-
bution to the development of oral communication abilities, as AI excels
at evaluating students’ pronunciation and providing tailored sugges-
tions to enhance their speaking skills. Guo et al. (2023) proposed an
innovative approach to classroom debates by utilizing chatbots to
facilitate students’ preparation through engagement in argumentative
discourse. Their results demonstrated that students effectively generated
ideas by interacting with the chatbot. Additionally, students expressed
positive attitudes toward the integration of the chatbot in debate
preparation.
Wang and Xue (2024) explored the role of an AI-powered chatbot in
enhancing the academic engagement of Chinese EFL students. Their
findings revealed that students demonstrated higher levels of behav-
ioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement in the language learning
process. This improvement was attributed to the chatbot’s ability to
provide a personalized learning experience with timely and individu-
alized feedback, fostering a supportive learning environment that
further encourages student participation. Additionally, Ji et al. (2024)
investigated the interactions among teachers, students, and conversa-
tional AI (CAI) in language education, highlighting evidence of collab-
oration between the teacher and CAI in facilitating learning activities.
Acting as a virtual native speaker, the CAI enabled students to practice
vocabulary pronunciation and provided word definitions with accurate
native pronunciation. Teachers played a crucial role in supporting these
student–CAI
interactions,
effectively
managing
activities
through
real-time reflective guidance.
In the context of language assessment, O (2024) demonstrated that
Chat GPT-generated English test questions closely align with those
created by human instructors in terms of content. This highlights AI’s
potential to support teachers in test item creation, effectively reducing
their workload and saving time. Lu, Yao, et al. (2024) examined
Chat GPT as a supplementary tool for assessing undergraduate academic
Chinese writing. The study found moderate to good consistency between
Chat GPT and teacher evaluations, though Chat GPT’s feedback was often
more abstract and less detailed than teachers’ feedback. Three key ways
in which Chat GPT complements teacher assessments were identified:
fostering a deeper understanding of feedback, encouraging critical
evaluation, and promoting independent thinking during the revision
process.
From a psychological perspective, Chen (2024) explored the impact
of technology-enhanced language learning on reducing public speaking
anxiety among EFL learners, highlighting the potential of AI-driven tools
to alleviate anxiety and enhance learning outcomes. By integrating AI
with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), learners received analytical
feedback and were able to monitor their speaking progress. The study
found that AI-generated instructional feedback significantly reduced
students’ public speaking anxiety.
3.2.1.1.4. Other disciplines. Beyond the previously discussed disci-
plines, two studies investigated the application of conversational AI and
related technologies in higher education across other fields. Fuller et al.
(2024) examined the use of Chat GPT for analyzing open-ended student
course evaluation comments in pharmacy education. The study
compared the themes identified by course instructors with those
generated by Chat GPT, revealing a high level of agreement between the
two. Moreover, Chat GPT significantly reduced the time required for
analysis, alleviating instructors’ workload while offering more detailed
insights into the identified themes, thereby enhancing the overall
analytical process.
Vartiainen and Tedre (2023) explored the use of AI in craft educa-
tion, focusing on text-to-image generation models. Through practical
workshops, the study examined teachers’ perspectives on the challenges
and opportunities of integrating generative AI into craft practices.
Teachers emphasized that AI could enhance the ideation process by
offering fresh perspectives and visualizing both realistic and imaginative
designs. However, concerns were raised regarding data-driven design,
particularly issues such as algorithmic bias and the "black-boxing" of
creativity.
3.2.1.2. K-12 education. Among the eight studies conducted in K-12
education, conversational AI and related technologies were primarily
utilized to facilitate lesson planning, instruction, and assessment. For
example, Al Ali and Al-Barakat (2023) investigated the potential of
Chat GPT as a tool to enhance teaching effectiveness in kindergarten
classrooms. The study identified two key applications of Chat GPT: first,
it assists kindergarten teachers in expanding students’ linguistic skills by
generating example sentences from curated vocabulary lists, thereby
supporting language development. Second, Chat GPT facilitates the
creation of differentiated learning activities tailored to individual stu-
dent needs, including those with special needs such as autism or atten-
tion
deficit
disorder,
thus
promoting
inclusivity
and
student
engagement.
Yuan (2023) explored the integration of an AI chatbot in English
language instruction at a Chinese elementary school. The findings
revealed that students who used the AI chatbot outperformed their peers
in traditional classrooms in terms of oral English proficiency and will-
ingness to communicate. By creating a supportive and non-judgmental
environment, chatbots not only improved students’ language skills but
also reduced anxiety and increased their confidence in speaking English.
Similarly, Evmenova et al. (2024) examined the effectiveness and lim-
itations of AI in providing feedback to elementary school students with
varying proficiency levels of writing. The study found that Chat GPT
could follow purposeful prompts and evaluate student essays using a
criterion-based rubric when supplied. However, the feedback quality
varied across different Chat GPT versions and prompts, and there was a
noticeable lack of alignment between AI-generated feedback and indi-
vidual student characteristics, such as proficiency level or specific needs.
In a related context, Yuxiu (2024) developed an AI translation
teaching system module that incorporated neural machine translation
(NMT) and statistical machine translation (SMT) algorithms to enhance
translation accuracy and teaching effectiveness. Implemented in sec-
ondary school settings, the module provided students with real-time
translation tools, translation evaluations, and constructive feedback,
effectively supporting their translation skill development and overall
learning experience.
Karaman
and
G¨oksu
(2024)
evaluated
the
effectiveness
of
Chat GPT-generated lesson plans in elementary mathematics education.
The study found that Chat GPT’s lesson plans were equally effective
compared to teacher-prepared plans in improving students’ mathe-
matics achievement. Chat GPT leveraged extensive data to design in-
clusive and structured lesson plans, incorporating elements such as clear
learning objectives, real-life connections, cooperative learning, peer
learning, creativity, and regular feedback. The plans also featured
effective time management and flexibility, making them comparable to
traditional,
teacher-prepared
lessons
in
achieving
educational
outcomes.
Yetis¸ensoy
and
Karaduman
(2024)
explored
the
use
of
an
AI-powered chatbot, Sosyalci Bot, in teaching 6th-grade social studies on
X. Tan et al.

the topic of “Culture and Heritage”. Their findings revealed that students
who used the chatbot achieved higher test scores and exhibited better
knowledge retention. Contributing factors included the chatbot’s inte-
gration of images, voice and text-based content delivery, clue-supported
Q&A activities, and instant feedback, all of which students recognized as
enhancing their learning experience.
Finally, Kasepalu et al. (2022) investigated the potential of AI to
support teachers in managing collaborative learning (CL) activities more
effectively, with a specific focus on upper secondary biology classes. The
study examined how teachers interacted with an AI assistant during
synchronous, face-to-face CL sessions, assessing its perceived usefulness
and its capacity to prompt pedagogical actions, particularly in relation
to coregulation strategies. The findings revealed that teachers viewed
the AI assistant as a valuable resource and adopted the AI-recommended
intervention strategies to improve collaborative learning outcomes.
Together, these studies indicate that the transformative potential of
conversational AI and related technologies in K-12 education, particu-
larly their ability to enhance teaching efficiency, enrich student learning
experiences, provide personalized feedback, and foster higher-order
thinking skills among students. However, challenges remain in the
educational application of these technologies, including concerns about
data privacy, maintaining academic integrity, and effectively inte-
grating these technologies into existing teaching practices, as high-
lighted by secondary English teachers (Fassbender, 2024).
3.2.1.3. Other educational contexts. In addition to their applications in
higher education and K-12 settings, conversational AI and related
technologies have also been employed in special education, professional
training, and other teaching contexts. In these diverse educational en-
vironments, chatbots have taken on multiple roles, including designing
learning goals, generating lesson plans, promoting self-regulated
learning, and supporting various instructional strategies.
In special education, two studies (Rakap, 2024; Rakap & Balikci,
2024) have investigated the potential of Chat GPT in supporting teachers
to formulate goals for Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) in
special education. The findings indicate that teachers using Chat GPT not
only focused more on higher-quality goals related to communication,
social skills, motor/sensory abilities, and self-care but also spent
significantly less time developing these goals compared to their coun-
terparts. Additionally, the Chat GPT-assisted goals were more compre-
hensive, effectively addressing the specific strengths and needs of
children with autism.
In professional training, Cooper (2024) evaluated Chat GPT’s effec-
tiveness in creating lesson plans for music training courses. The study
found that teachers struggled to differentiate between AI-generated and
human-created plans, though the AI plans were rated lower in quality.
Teachers were most likely to identify a plan as AI-generated when it
lacked specificity or failed to reflect adequate musical or pedagogical
knowledge suited to classroom requirements. Ghafouri et al. (2024)
explored the use of Chat GPT in EFL teacher training, focusing on its
effects on teachers’ self-efficacy and students’ writing skills. They
introduced a three-phase writing instruction protocol (CGWIP) incor-
porating Chat GPT for planning, instruction, and assessment. Chat GPT
was used to brainstorm ideas, engage students in writing and reflection,
and provide detailed feedback by simulating public writing exams. The
study found that the protocol improved teachers’ efficiency in writing
instruction and enhanced students’ writing skills.
Karatas¸ et al. (2024) conducted a case study to explore the impact of
Chat GPT on students’ language learning experiences in a university
preparatory foreign language class. Students utilized Chat GPT for
diverse learning activities, such as creating posts and stories, planning
virtual field trips, engaging in role-plays and debates, and brainstorming
research questions. The findings revealed that Chat GPT significantly
enhanced students’ writing, grammar, and vocabulary skills while also
boosting their motivation and engagement in language learning.
Moreover, Chiu (2024) examined how Chat GPT-based learning ac-
tivities address students’ needs for autonomy, competence, and relat-
edness while supporting each phase of self-regulated learning from a
teacher’s
perspective.
The
study
developed
a
classification
tool
comprising 20 Chat GPT-based learning activities to help researchers
replicate, implement, and integrate effective Chat GPT practices in
educational research and projects.
Overall, these studies demonstrate that conversational AI and related
technologies can significantly enhance the effectiveness and quality of
instruction across various educational levels. However, they also un-
derscore several challenges, including over-reliance on AI tools, diffi-
culties in evaluating AI-generated content, the necessity for teachers to
develop AI competency, concerns about the validity and completeness of
feedback, academic integrity issues, and ethical and bias considerations.
3.2.2. AI-driven learning and assessment systems
Five studies examined the application of AI-driven learning and
assessment systems from the perspective of teachers, focusing on how
these technologies can be integrated into teaching practices to enhance
educational quality and effectiveness (see Fig. 8 for the treemap).
Niu et al. (2022) investigated the implementation of an AI-assisted
education platform, namely “Smart-Learning Partner”, in Chinese
lower secondary schools. This AI-powered platform provides opportu-
nities for personalized learning and access to enriched educational re-
sources. Using qualitative methods, including interviews and surveys,
the study included 98 students and 32 teachers from nine schools in less
developed regions of China. The findings revealed that both teachers
and students regarded the platform as a valuable tool for education. It
offered diverse self-assessment tools, personalized and comprehensive
performance reports, and tailored recommendations to address indi-
vidual student needs.
Zhang (2024) developed the Flipped Teaching and Assessment
Model (MAFTA) using an AI-enabled MOOC platform to enhance uni-
versity English teachers’ Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge
(TPACK) and improve the quality of students’ written work. MAFTA
integrated a flipped learning approach, where students watched MOOC
lessons before class to learn genre structures and techniques, along with
two additional tools: a scenario-based reading-to-write (SBRt W) plat-
form and the AI-powered automated writing evaluation (AWE) system.
The SBRt W platform used real-life scenarios, virtual tutor characters,
and reading materials to guide students’ writing, providing scaffolding
and enhancing their learning experience.
Other studies have focused on the use of AI-driven learning and
assessment systems to automate the assessment of student learning
processes and outcomes. For example, dos Santos et al. (2022) explored
how teachers could assess rhythm-related dance skills using motion
sensor data from smartphones in professional training. The study
demonstrated the feasibility of extracting rhythmic information from
smartphone sensors. The extracted data inspired ideas for integrating
such data into their pedagogical practices, thereby enriching educa-
tional approaches.
Krange et al. (2023) developed an AI-based automated essay
assessment tool (EAT) to provide targeted feedback on areas where
8th-grade students need improvement in English writing skills. The EAT
effectively supports students’ writing development by utilizing detailed
feedback logs generated for each student’s writing trajectory. Its effec-
tiveness could be further enhanced through active teacher guidance,
including assisting students in identifying errors and interpreting the
feedback.
In addition, Tomi´c et al. (2023) investigated the use of a modular AI
system to assess and grade collaboration in group programming projects.
They implemented and evaluated four AI methods—fuzzy rules, neural
networks, decision trees, and random forests. The findings indicate that
these AI methods can effectively generate grading recommendations
when integrated into the proposed framework, provided that teachers
address additional assessment aspects, such as code quality, plagiarism,

and project completion.
In summary, these studies emphasized the crucial role of teachers in
facilitating students’ effective use of AI-driven learning and assessment
systems, demonstrating how AI could enhance educational platforms
and optimize the teaching, learning and assessment process. However,
they also highlighted challenges in applying these technologies, such as
technological limitations, acceptance barriers among students and
teachers, and the need for professional development to support teachers
in effectively integrating these AI-driven systems into their teaching
practices.
3.2.3. Immersive technologies
Four studies explored the role of immersive technologies, such as
augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and robotics, in promoting
teaching innovation and enhancing the learning experience (see Fig. 9).
These studies were conducted primarily in higher education and focused
on disciplines such as arts and linguistics.
For instance, Miralay (2024) examined the integration of AI and AR
technologies in higher education art courses, focusing on their benefits
and limitations. The study revealed that these technologies enable stu-
dents to create moving objects, significantly enhancing their motivation,
creativity, and imagination. However, it also highlighted a potential
drawback: a decline in traditional drawing and manual painting skills.
This research underscores the transformative potential of AI and AR in
art education while acknowledging their impact on foundational artistic
techniques.
Ma (2021) examined the use of virtual reality (VR) technology in
immersive English teaching for university students, incorporating
constructivist theory into VR-based instruction. The findings showed
that students in the experimental group, who experienced VR-enhanced
teaching, achieved significantly greater improvements in English
listening and speaking skills compared to those who did not receive
VR-based instruction. This highlights the potential of VR technology to
effectively enhance language proficiency.
Shu
and
Gu
(2023)
investigated
the
impact
of
an
Edu-Metaverse-supported intelligent education model on the learning
outcomes of university English students. The study found that those
using the Edu-Metaverse model significantly outperformed their peers in
traditional teaching settings in areas such as writing, reading compre-
hension, vocabulary, grammar, and speaking. The findings underscored
the model’s effectiveness in promoting deep learning, enhancing
higher-order thinking skills, and cultivating more capable learners in
Fig. 8. The use of AI-driven learning and assessment systems in teaching.

online environments. Key contributors to these outcomes included an
ecological teaching environment, multimodal course resources, and
innovative pedagogy, which also encouraged greater student engage-
ment and participation.
Additionally, Yang et al. (2023) introduced a gamified AI education
robot (AIER) to improve learning in university laboratory safety courses.
The study demonstrated that AIER significantly enhanced students’ ac-
ademic
performance,
motivation,
problem-solving
abilities,
and
engagement compared to traditional methods. Using a level-based,
storyline-driven approach, AIER integrated resources such as video
lectures, quizzes, and tests while offering progress tracking and skill
badges to sustain motivation. AIER also reduced cognitive load,
contributing to more effective and engaging learning experiences.
These studies demonstrate the transformative potential of immersive
technologies in education. By leveraging such technologies, educators
can create personalized and engaging learning experiences that boost
student motivation and improve outcomes. However, effective imple-
mentation requires teachers to develop specific technical skills, as these
technologies pose significant challenges. Furthermore, the high cost of
immersive devices risks exacerbating the digital divide, underscoring
the need for equitable access and sustainable solutions.
3.2.4. Visual and auditory computing
Eight studies explored the application of visual and auditory
computing technologies in education, primarily focusing on analyzing
learners’ multimodal behaviors and performances to enhance the un-
derstanding of the learning process (see Fig. 10 for the treemap).
In the field of language learning, Qiao and Zhao (2023) examined the
effectiveness of AI-based teaching tools in enhancing second language
(L2) speaking skills and promoting self-regulation among college stu-
dents in China. Their study focused on the AI application Duolingo,
which leverages speech recognition technology to create an interactive
and engaging environment for speaking practice. By providing person-
alized feedback, Duolingo facilitated significantly greater improvements
in L2 speaking skills compared to traditional instructional methods.
Shafiee
Rad
(2024)
examined
the
impact
of
the
speech
recognition-enabled
application
Speeko
on
L2
college
students’
speaking proficiency, willingness to communicate, and perceptions. The
findings revealed that students using Speeko outperformed their peers,
benefiting from its personalized and interactive features. Speeko pro-
vided real-time feedback on speech, pronunciation, and grammar,
helping learners correct mistakes effectively. Additionally, it reduced
anxiety, enhanced public speaking confidence, and sustained engage-
ment through motivational elements like digital rewards. Likewise, Tai
(2024) examined the impact of intelligent personal assistants (IPAs),
such as Google Assistant, on bilingual education (BE) teachers’
English-speaking proficiency. The findings demonstrated that IPAs,
leveraging
speech
recognition
technology,
significantly
enhanced
teachers’s English-speaking proficiency by creating authentic commu-
nication environments, increasing practice opportunities, and providing
immediate, personalized feedback.
Additionally, Mohammadkarimi (2024) investigated the use of Listnr
and Murf AI AI tools to improve pronunciation skills among elementary
and pre-intermediate IELTS learners. These tools utilize advanced
speech recognition and machine learning technologies to deliver
personalized feedback, real-time assessment, and adaptive learning ex-
periences. The study highlighted their effectiveness in enhancing pro-
nunciation accuracy, building learners’ confidence, and increasing
engagement through focused practice and tailored support.
In the field of music education, Liu (2022) examined the supportive
role of AI technologies in enhancing college music instruction. The study
explored the development of an AI-based music teaching evaluation
system, utilizing emotion recognition as a key metric to assess and
improve teaching quality and efficiency. Experimental results demon-
strated that integrating AI with music education effectively reduces
human and material costs while enhancing the overall quality and
effectiveness of instruction. Moreover, Mao (2022) proposed a music
education model integrating AI into the model-view-controller (MVC)
framework
to
enhance
traditional
school
teaching
methods.
By
employing intelligent adjustments to computational audio and triband
equalizers, the model reduces the need for physical space and musical
instrument resources in music education. The study found that AI-based
music education achieved higher satisfaction levels among students,
teachers, and parents compared to traditional approaches.
In the field of science education, Lee et al. (2023) explored the use of
an AI Speaker in collaborative learning, termed CLAIS, within the
context of science education. CLAIS facilitated small-group Jigsaw
learning by integrating 3–4 human learners and an AI Speaker as peers.
Using the ADDIE model, the researchers designed and developed the
CLAIS system and evaluated its application among pre-service elemen-
tary science teachers. Through mixed-method surveys, participants
provided feedback from multiple perspectives—teachers, learners,

Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence 8 (2025) 100355

peers, and users—expressing positive attitudes toward the CLAIS
learning experience.
In physical education, He et al. (2024) developed an interactive
AI-based system leveraging visual analysis to enhance the teaching of
the 400-m run for university students. The system comprised three
modules: behavior information, user data collection, and behavior
assessment. It utilized Kinect v2 to capture students’ movements and
employed feature extraction algorithms to analyze their running tech-
niques. Teachers and students could access the performance data,
enabling targeted and effective guidance. The study revealed that sys-
tematic instruction using this system significantly improved students’
400-m run times by 6–7 seconds.
These studies demonstrate the integration of AI technologies across
diverse educational fields, including language learning, music educa-
tion, and physical education, to deliver personalized learning experi-
ences and real-time feedback. By leveraging visual and auditory
computing technologies, educators can gain deeper insights into stu-
dents’ learning processes through the analysis of their performance and
behavior. However, further research is required to improve the accuracy
and reliability of AI-based assessments, particularly for evaluating stu-
dents’ deeper cognitive states. Despite these challenges, the studies
provide valuable perspectives on learner analysis, especially in areas
such
as
behavior
recognition,
emotion
recognition,
and
speech
recognition.
3.2.5. Teaching and learning analytics
Seven studies explored the use of teaching and learning analytics
(TLA) technology, aiming to enhance teaching practices and improve
learning outcomes through the collection and analysis of educational
data (see Fig. 11 for the treemap).
Four of these studies specifically focused on the use of AI technolo-
gies to collect and analyze student learning data. Holstein et al. (2019)
introduced Lumilo, a wearable real-time LA tool designed to support
teachers in middle school mathematics classrooms. Lumilo used
mixed-reality smart glasses to provide teachers with immediate feed-
back on student learning status, enabling informed instructional de-
cisions and better support for individual student needs. The study
highlighted an iterative co-design process, involving teachers at every
stage of the design of the LA system—from identifying needs and
designing features to evaluating the tool in live classrooms. Lampos et al.
(2021) investigated the use of AI in autism education to enhance
communication strategies for children with autism spectrum conditions
(ASC).
Using
machine
learning,
they
analyzed
teacher-student
interactions to predict student responses to specific communication
approaches under various classroom conditions. Their findings showed
that AI tools could reliably identify strategies likely to elicit positive
responses, highlighting the potential of AI to support personalized
educational practices for students with ASC.
In addition, Echeverria et al. (2023) investigated shared control
designs
for
managing
dynamic
transitions
between
individual
problem-solving practice and mutual peer tutoring activities. Using a
technology probe, the AI system monitored and analyzed students’ skills
to enable flexible, on-demand shifts and pair lower-skill tutees with
higher-skill tutors. The findings highlighted the importance of shared
control, influenced by prior knowledge and classroom contexts, in
supporting effective and adaptive learning transitions. Zhu et al. (2023)
introduced the Boosting and Decision Tree Regression-based Scoring
Prediction (BDTR-SP) model to improve the accuracy of predicting
university students’ performance in computer science courses. The
model combines decision tree regression with an ensemble learning
structure to analyze students’ learning behaviors and prior performance.
Experimental results highlighted its ability to identify key factors
influencing grades and deliver accurate predictions, enabling teachers to
proactively adjust their teaching strategies and enhance instructional
quality.
Two studies examined the use of TLA to provide personalized feed-
back and recommendations, supporting teachers in making informed
instructional decisions. In one study, Phillips et al. (2022) developed an
AI toolkit to support teachers in reflecting on their teaching practices
and curriculum design. The toolkit employed natural language pro-
cessing and deep learning techniques to predict the difficulty of assess-
ment items and lecture materials. By analyzing assessment and linguistic
data collected from an undergraduate biology course, the toolkit
demonstrated high accuracy in predicting challenging content. This
capability could enable teachers to continuously reflect on student
performance and lecture difficulty. In another study, Zheng et al. (2024)
proposed an automated multimodal teaching behavior analysis frame-
work based on event segmentation. This framework utilized deep
learning technology to measure teachers’ verbal interactions, emotions,
gaze patterns, and physical location in university and primary school
classrooms. By integrating multimodal analysis, the framework could
provide a comprehensive and objective evaluation of teaching practices,
offering valuable insights into classroom dynamics and teacher perfor-
mance. It could also identify variations in teacher behavior across
different teaching styles, methods, and classroom settings.
Additionally, Li (2024) explored the use of AI and data science in the
Fig. 11. The use of teaching and learning analytics.
X. Tan et al.

digital transformation of college English teaching by analyzing class-
room environments. The study introduced the English Smart Classroom
Teaching with the Internet of Things (ESCT-Io T), where it integrated Io T
sensors, AI algorithms, and data science techniques to create personal-
ized learning experiences. The impact of this approach on teaching
effectiveness was assessed using fuzzy hierarchical evaluation technol-
ogy, providing comprehensive insights into the instructional outcomes.
The findings emphasized the importance of leveraging advanced ana-
lytics and large-scale data solutions to promote personalized and
adaptive learning.
Overall, TLA technology enhances teaching quality and improves
student learning outcomes by leveraging AI to gather and analyze
teaching and learning data, while also providing teachers with person-
alized feedback and actionable recommendations. However, effective
implementation of this technology requires teachers to have strong data
processing and interpretation skills.
3.3. RQ3: what are the major research areas on teacher professional
development programmes aimed at supporting the integration of AI in
teaching practices?
Among the 33 studies, a focused examination of teachers’ profes-
sional development in the application of AI identifies four main cate-
gories:
elements
and
factors
influencing
teacher
professional
development,
implementation
approaches
in
teacher
professional
development, AI technologies supporting teacher professional develop-
ment, and the evaluation of teacher professional development outcomes.
The following sections examine each of these categories in detail,
highlighting the key considerations and challenges associated with
teacher professional development in implementing AI in teaching
practices.
3.3.1. Elements and factors influencing teacher professional development
Five studies investigatied various elements and factors influencing
teacher professional development in AI technology from multiple per-
spectives. The word cloud in Fig. 12 visually represents these elements
and factors, with the size of each word indicating its relative frequency
across the studies. This visualization method highlights prominent
themes, such as “AI Knowledge”, “AI Application”, and “AI Ethics”,
providing an overview of the key considerations shaping teacher pro-
fessional development in AI technology.
Two studies examined the relationships among various dimensions
of teachers’ AI literacy. Zhao et al. (2022), using Structural Equation
Modeling (SEM) analysis, investigated the development of AI literacy
among primary and secondary school teachers in China. The findings
revealed that applying AI had a significantly positive impact on the
other three dimensions: knowing and understanding AI, evaluating AI
applications, and AI ethics. Similarly, Ayanwale, Adelana, et al. (2024)
assessed the AI literacy of pre-service teachers at a university in Nigeria.
They used SEM analysis to explore the relationships between various
dimensions of AI literacy. The findings revealed that a deep under-
standing of AI strongly predicts AI use, detection, ethics, creation, and
problem-solving abilities. However, the study also reported that AI
knowledge did not correlate with emotional regulation, nor did AI use
correlate with the ability to detect instances of AI.
In a separate study, Ayanwale, Frimpong, et al. (2024) investigated
the factors influencing pre-service teachers’ participation in AI-related
professional development programmes. The study identified several
key determinants that significantly impact their engagement in AI
learning, including attitudes toward AI, levels of anxiety, AI readiness,
self-transcendence goals, and learning confidence. Ahmed et al. (2022)
examined the motivations and barriers faced by Malaysian university
professors in adopting AI-based teaching solutions from a macro-level
perspective. The study emphasized that schools must provide teachers
with adequate resources, support, and recognition to facilitate the
adoption of AI-based instruction. Furthermore, higher education in-
stitutions were identified as needing to offer teachers multiple resources,
such as funding and technological equipment, to support the integration
of AI into teaching practices.
Moreover, Nguyen (2024) examined the interplay between teacher
professional development, lecture design quality, student engagement,
technical skills, pedagogical content knowledge, and teacher satisfaction
in the context of using AI-powered tools for lecture design. The study
found that teacher professional development, lecture design quality, and
student
engagement
positively
influence
teacher
satisfaction.
In
contrast, technical skills were found to have a negative impact on
teacher satisfaction, while pedagogical content knowledge was not
shown to have a significant effect.
These studies collectively highlight the elements and factors influ-
encing AI-related teacher professional development. They illustrate the
importance of AI in enhancing teacher professional development,
particularly in terms of improving teaching efficiency, student engage-
ment, and overall teacher satisfaction. Meanwhile, they emphasize the
crucial role of professional development in preparing teachers to effec-
tively integrate AI technologies into the classroom. However, the studies
also identify signifcant barriers to implementation, including limited
technological knowledge, low teacher awareness and acceptance of AI,
and ethical concerns.
3.3.2. Implementation approaches in teacher professional development
Seven studies demonstrated that well-designed professional devel-
opment programmes can significantly improve teachers’ self-efficacy
beliefs, teaching skills, and mastery of AI knowledge in the context of
AI-integrated teaching. The distribution of implementation approaches
is depicted in Fig. 13.
Four of these studies proposed approaches to conducting profes-
sional development programmes from a pedagogical perspective. For
example, Kim (2024) examined the impact of an AI education pro-
gramme on the AI convergence teaching capabilities of pre-service
teachers, utilizing the TPACK framework. Sun et al. (2023) developed
a professional development programme grounded in the TPACK
framework, which resulted in significant improvements in in-service
computer science teachers’ AI knowledge, AI teaching skills, and AI
teaching self-efficacy. Similarly, Saimon et al. (2024) explored the po-
tential of the 6E Learning by Design model—comprising the stages of
Engage, Explore, Explain, Engineer, Enrich, and Evaluate—in support-
ing pre-service teachers to successfully integrate AI applications into
their classrooms. Ding, Kim, and Allday (2024) analyzed the effects of a
case-based professional development programme focused on AI inte-
gration strategies and AI literacy for secondary school science teachers.
Their findings underscored the significance of blending direct instruc-
tion with case-based discussions to enhance teachers’ AI literacy more
effectively.

Three other studies focused on approaches to enhancing self-efficacy
and building confidence in integrating AI technologies into teaching. For
example, Nazaretsky et al. (2022) investigated K-12 teachers’ trust and
attitudes toward adopting AI-powered educational technologies. The
study revealed that offering clear explanations of AI decision-making
processes, particularly by comparing them with the reasoning of
human experts, and emphasizing how AI serves as a supportive tool
rather than a replacement for teachers, can alleviate concerns and foster
greater trust in AI technologies for education.
Furthermore, Yang et al. (2024) explored how a professional devel-
opment programme grounded in social cognitive theory could enhance
in-service primary school teachers’ confidence in integrating AI tech-
nologies into English-speaking instruction. The study demonstrated that
teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs improved through a programme empha-
sizing community support, observational learning, and modeling. Tatar
et al. (2024) investigated how a curricular co-design programme could
influence experienced English Language Arts (ELA) teachers’ confidence
and perceptions of integrating AI concepts into their classrooms.
Throughout the programme, teachers actively engaged with the cur-
riculum modules as learners and provided feedback on the feasibility
and effectiveness for incorporating these modules into their teaching
practices.
Overall, these studies offer valuable insights into how teacher pro-
fessional development can enhance teachers’ AI competency. However,
most studies focus on short-term professional development programmes,
with limited evaluation of their long-term impact. While some research
indicates that teachers acquire a solid understanding of AI concepts
during training, gaps remain in their ability to apply this knowledge in
practical classroom settings. Given the rapid evolution of AI technolo-
gies, it is essential to explore strategies for providing continuous training
and support, ensuring that teachers are equipped to effectively integrate
AI into their teaching practices over time.
3.3.3. AI Technologies supporting teacher professional development
Fifteen studies investigated the role of various AI technologies in
supporting teacher professional development. The distribution of AI
technologies used is illustrated in Fig. 14.
3.3.3.1. Chatbots. Nine studies highlighted the role of chatbots in sup-
porting teacher professional development. Among them, Moorhouse,
Wan, Wu, et al. (2024) conducted an 11-week intervention study to
examine how generative AI tools, particularly chatbots such as Chat GPT,
AI Chat, and Poe, can enhance the professional generative AI compe-
tence (P-Gen AI-C) of pre-service language teachers. The P-Gen AI-C
framework encompasses five aspects: technical proficiency, pedagogical
competency, teachers’ professional tasks, risk, well-being and ethical
use, as well as preparation of students. The study reported improve-
ments in participants’ professional development across all aspects, with
the most significant gains in pedagogical competency and critical
awareness of generative AI tools deployment in educational contexts. In
another study, Moorhouse, Wan, Ho, and Lin (2024) explored the
application of a generative AI tool based on Chat GPT to support
pre-service language teachers in incorporating their first language (L1)
in second language (L2) instruction. They found that explicit instruction,
combined with generative AI-assisted and evidence-informed strategies,
could increase pre-service language teachers’ intention to use L1 in L2
lessons and provide effective support for its integration.
Lu, Zheng, et al. (2024) implemented Chat GPT-assisted teaching
skills training to support teachers’ professional development across
three phases: preparation, implementation and evaluation. Their find-
ings revealed that Chat GPT-assisted training significantly enhanced
pre-service teachers’ self-efficacy and higher-order thinking skills
compared to traditional training methods. Similarly, Chang and Hwang
(2024) conducted an experimental study comparing Chat GPT-based
training for clinical teachers’ professional development with tradi-
tional training. They found that the Chat GPT-based approach effectively

Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence 8 (2025) 100355

enhanced clinical teachers’ learning outcomes, sense of self-worth, and
self-confidence compared to the traditional approach.
Furthermore, Tsou et al. (2024) found that Chat GPT facilitated a
co-journeying process with in-service language teachers in tertiary ed-
ucation. By addressing challenges associated with Chat GPT, extending
its applications, and exploring innovative uses, teachers reported
increased confidence in teaching English and a more empowered English
as a Medium of Instruction (EMI) teacher identity. Mbambo and Du
Plessis (2024) demonstrated the overall effectiveness of AI technologies,
particularly Chat GPT, in supporting academic work during teacher
training within open distance and electronic learning (ODe L) environ-
ments. The study highlighted the positive impact of AI on teaching
training but emphasized the importance of thoroughly evaluating AI
tools prior to implementation. Such evaluations are crucial to ensure
that AI does not compromise the integrity of educational assessments or
raise ethical concerns.
Yeh (2024) found that Chat GPT could assist EFL teachers in creating
interactive and adaptive learning materials, such as picture books and
karaoke exercises, to enhance language teaching. By generating
personalized content and supporting the development of students’
communicative skills, Chat GPT was shown to facilitate a more dynamic
and student-centred learning environment. Kusuma et al. (2024)
examined the use of Chat GPT in the professional development of English
language teaching, with a focus on enhancing pre-service EFL teachers’
teaching practices. Through qualitative research, the study revealed that
pre-service EFL teachers utilized Chat GPT for creating innovative
teaching
materials,
developing
collaborative
teaching
strategies,
designing effective assessments, and improving their language profi-
ciency. While some concerns were raised about the quality and accuracy
of the information generated by Chat GPT, pre-service teachers generally
perceived it as a valuable tool for their professional growth.
Finally, Son et al. (2024) explored the use of AI-based chatbots as
both virtual students and virtual mentors to support the development of
pre-service teachers’ professional skills in teaching mathematics. The
study highlighted that AI-based chatbots could enable more interactive
teaching practices by simulating teaching scenarios with a virtual stu-
dent while providing real-time feedback from a virtual mentor. This
simulated approach could offer pre-service teachers opportunities to
engage in teaching practices and reflective processes.
3.3.3.2. Other AI technologies. In addition to chatbots, several studies
explored the role of other technologies in supporting teacher profes-
sional development, such as diagnostic and feedback system, learning
analytics, intelligent tutoring systems, and immersive environments. For
example, Gunawan et al. (2021) investigated an AI-assisted professional
development programme designed to enhance science teachers’ com-
petencies in fostering higher-order thinking skills in science education.
The programme utilized a blended learning model, integrating both
online and offline teaching methods, and leveraged an AI-driven
assessment and feedback system to offer personalized teaching sugges-
tions and feedback based on the results of a diagnostic test completed by
the participating teachers.
Elgohary and Al-Dossary (2022) investigated the effectiveness of
using AI-driven virtual classrooms in enhancing field training skills for
female student teachers. The study found that AI technology signifi-
cantly improved the field training and teaching skills of student teachers
in virtual classroom environments. This improvement was attributed to
the AI-assisted development of digital presentations, which effectively
facilitated the explanation and demonstration of teaching skills within
the virtual classroom.
Copur-Gencturk et al. (2024) developed a virtual interactive pro-
fessional development programme utilizing intelligent tutoring systems
to deliver immediate feedback to teachers. The study found that teachers
who completed the programme were more effective in selecting math-
ematics
tasks
and
fostering
students’
conceptual
understanding
compared to those who did not participate in the training.
Tammets and Ley (2023) proposed a conceptual model to explore the
complexities of integrating AI tools into teacher professional learning.
Their study focused on how model-based learning analytics tools can
support teachers in making informed decisions, aligning their practices
with competency frameworks, and fostering professional growth.
Additionally, the study introduced the idea of teachers collaborating
with researchers in the design of AI tools, highlighting its potential to
contribute to the long-term development of teacher professional
practices.
Moreover, Agrati (2023) and Lee et al. (2024) both explored the use
of metaverse technology in teacher professional development. Agrati
(2023) examined participants’ perceptions of the metaverse as a
learning environment and the role of AI in teacher training, with a
particular focus on utilizing AI-guided non-player characters as mentors
within the metaverse. Lee et al. (2024) studied the potential of using AI
chatbots in a 3D metaverse environment to enhance per-service English
teachers’ awareness of global English, particularly improving their
confidence and intentions to use English as a Lingua Franca.
These studies illustrate the potential of AI technologies to provide
personalized learning experiences and enhance teacher professional
development. AI can offer teachers flexible opportunities for profes-
sional development while helping them to develop proficiency in spe-
cific AI tools. However, these studies also underscore challenges in
implementing AI-driven teacher training, such as ensuring effective
integration of technology, addressing its limitations, and balancing
technological innovation with educational goals.
3.3.4. Evaluation of teacher professional development outcomes
Evaluation is a critical component of teacher professional develop-
ment, particularly in assessing teachers’ competency in applying AI. Six
studies have highlighted the need for robust assessment tools to evaluate
teachers’ AI literacy and competency. Fig. 15 presents a radar chart
offering a multidimensional visualization of the evaluation instruments
and methods.
Building on the TPACK framework, two studies have proposed scales
that incoporate AI into the TPACK model. For example, Celik (2023)
introduced the Intelligent-TPACK scale, an extension of the TPACK
framework, to evaluate teachers’ knowledge of instructional AI use,
incorporating ethical considerations into the framework. The findings
highlighted that while teachers’ technological knowledge (TK) is crucial
for assessing AI-based systems, it alone is insufficient for effectively
integrating AI into educational practices. To use AI effectively in edu-
cation, teachers must understand its pedagogical affordances. The study
emphasized that TK becomes most meaningful when combined with
pedagogical
knowledge
(PK),
forming
technological
pedagogical
knowledge (TPK).
Ning et al. (2024) introduced the AI-TPACK framework to examine
the relationships and interactions among AI technologies, pedagogical
strategies, and subject-specific content within the context of education.
To explore these dynamics, the researchers applied a structural equation
modeling (SEM) approach to analyze the interconnections among the
knowledge components of teachers’ AI-TPACK. The results indicated
that technology-related knowledge elements—namely, AI Technological
Knowledge (AI-TK), AI Technological Content Knowledge (AI-TCK), and
AI Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (AI-TPK)—exhibited a signif-
icantly stronger correlation with the overall AI-TPACK framework
compared to non-technology-related elements.
Drawing on self-efficacy theory, researchers have developed scales to
evaluate teachers’ self-efficacy in using AI in educational settings. Chou
et al. (2023) introduced the teachers’ efficacy perception of AI-based
teaching applications (TEP-AITA) scale, which encompasses six com-
ponents: resource support, innovative teaching, cross-disciplinarity,
professional learning, learner demand, and self-reflection. In a subse-
quent study, Chou et al. (2024) developed the AI-Supported teaching
application self-efficacy (AIS-TASE) scale to predict teachers’ readiness
X. Tan et al.

--- Page 15 ---

Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence 8 (2025) 100355

and confidence in integrating AI-supported teaching applications. The
AIS-TASE scale includes five elements: self-affirmation, passion for
teaching, adherence to hard work, negative consciousness, and positive
belief. These scales provide frameworks for assessing and enhancing
teachers’ self-efficacy in integrating AI into their teaching practices.
Additionally, Ding, Kim, and Allday (2024) developed an AI literacy
assessment tool tailored for non-technical individuals, featuring 25
objective-based items that measure 17 AI competencies across five key
dimensions: understanding the nature of AI (4 competencies), recog-
nizing AI’s capabilities (2 competencies), mastering its underlying
mechanisms (9 competencies), discerning appropriate AI use (1 com-
petency), and understanding public perceptions of AI (1 competency).
The tool underwent evaluation by AI experts and was piloted with
pre-service and in-service teachers who had minimal or no technical
background, ensuring its applicability for users with limited technical
proficiency.
L´erias et al. (2024) used a validated questionnaire to evaluate the AI
literacy and knowledge levels of in-service university teachers, focusing
on
three
dimensions:
AI
literacy,
AI
self-efficacy,
and
AI
self-management. The AI literacy dimension included factors like usage
and application, knowledge and understanding, detection, and ethics. AI
self-efficacy covered problem-solving, learning, and skill integration,
while AI self-management addressed persuasion literacy and emotion
regulation. An analysis of the correlations among these dimensions
revealed that the AI literacy dimension was the strongest predictor of
overall AI literacy levels among teachers. Notably, no demographic
factors—such as age, gender, academic level taught, or area of train-
ing—were found to significantly influence AI literacy.
In summary, professional development programmes aimed at
enhancing teachers’ AI literacy and competency employ diverse and
multifaceted approaches. A thorough evaluation of these competencies
requires a holistic framework that addresses content comprehension,
technology integration, ethical considerations, and other pertinent fac-
tors. However, research in this area often remains limited in scope,
focusing narrowly on specific subjects or scenarios. Some fail to consider
the contextual variations in how teachers utilize AI in real teaching
environments or to fully explore the applicability and adaptability of AI
technologies across varied educational contexts.
4. Discussion
4.1. AI in teaching and teacher professional development
● Imbalance in research: Our systematic review identifies a signifi-
cant imbalance, with research on AI applications in teaching vastly
outnumbering studies focused on AI in teacher professional devel-
opment (Chiu et al., 2023; Ng et al., 2023; Zawacki-Richter et al.,
2019). This disparity highlights that, while the potential of AI in
teaching has been extensively explored, there remains a critical gap
in understanding how teachers can effectively integrate these tech-
nologies into their practices and enhance their AI competencies
through targeted professional development (Aljemely, 2024; Mey-
lani, 2024). From the teachers’ perspective, this imbalance reflects a
lack of structured support and guidance for professional growth in
the use of AI. This underscores the urgent need for research that
directly addresses teachers’ development needs, the barriers they
encounter in acquiring AI-related skills, and strategies for over-
coming these challenges. Bridging this gap is essential for empow-
ering teachers to harness the full potential of AI technologies in
education.
● Technological diversity and integration: Our systematic review
reveals a trend of rapid diversification of AI applications for teach-
ing, encompassing conversational AI and related technologies, AI-
driven learning and assessment systems, immersive technologies,
visual and auditory computing, and teaching and learning analytics.
This
diversification
places
significant
demands
on
teachers,
requiring a high level of technical knowledge and adaptability (Tang
et al., 2023; Yildirim & Celepcikay, 2021; Zhang & Aslan, 2021).
Teachers are increasingly expected to integrate these diverse tech-
nologies into various teaching contexts, which presents substantial
challenges for professional development (Galindo-Domínguez et al.,
2024). From the teachers’ perspective, the continuous influx of new
AI technologies can be overwhelming, necessitating frequent updates
to their technical knowledge and teaching methods to keep pace with
a rapidly evolving educational landscape (Love et al., 2020; Karroum
& Elshaiekh, 2023). Given these challenges, it is critical to identify
which AI technologies should be prioritized in AI-enhanced profes-
sional development programmes. Furthermore, there is a need to
define the specific competencies teachers must develop to effectively
integrate these tools into their teaching practices. This focus will help
Fig. 15. Evaluation instruments and methods for assessing teachers’ AI literacy and competency.
X. Tan et al.

Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence 8 (2025) 100355

ensure that professional development programmes are both targeted
and practical, addressing teachers’ immediate and long-term needs.
● Enhancing teachers’ AI literacy: Our systematic review highlights
that the importance of enhancing teachers’ AI literacy is frequently
emphasized in the literature on AI in teaching (Kasepalu et al., 2022;
Grajeda et al., 2023; Fassbender, 2024; Lee & Zhai, 2024; Rakap.
2024). However, there is a lack of research on effective strategies for
specifically improving teachers’ AI literacy. This gap suggests that
while teachers are increasingly expected to use AI technologies
proficiently, existing professional development programmes may not
adequately address the evolving skill requirements associated with
AI integration (Aljemely, 2024; Meylani, 2024). From the teachers’
perspective, the absence of focused AI literacy training presents a
significant barrier to effectively utilizing AI tools in classroom set-
tings. This underscores the needs to develop comprehensive strate-
gies and assessment tools for evaluating and enhancing teachers’ AI
literacy. Such initiatives would enable teachers to keep pace with
technological advancements and confidently apply AI in their
instructional practices.
4.2. Implications for further research
● Increasing focus on teacher professional development: Future
research should place greater emphasis on the role of AI in teacher
professional development, investigating how professional develop-
ment activities can enhance teachers’ understanding of AI technol-
ogies and improve their ability to integrate these tools into their
teaching practices. Studies could examine the impact of various
formats, durations, and intensities of professional development
programmes on improving teachers’ AI literacy and their effect on
teaching strategies and student learning outcomes (Meylani, 2024).
Additionally, research should prioritize understanding teachers’
personal experiences and feedback during the professional devel-
opment process, exploring how their attitudes, confidence and
competencies with AI technologies evolve over time (Lin, 2022;
Polak et al., 2022).
● Teacher AI literacy enhancement programmes: Develop and
implement specialized professional development programmes to
enhance teachers’ AI literacy and capabilities. These programmes
could include a mix of online courses, seminars, and workshops that
cover fundamental AI concepts, practical applications in teaching,
and ethical considerations (al-Zyoud, 2020; Kitcharoen et al., 2024).
In addition, it is necessary to establish a robust assessment mecha-
nism to evaluate the effectiveness of these programmes in improving
teachers’ AI literacy and capability development (Qin et al., 2021;
Celik, 2023; Ding, Shi, et al., 2024; Ning et al., 2024). Such mecha-
nisms would ensure continuous improvement and alignment of
professional development initiatives with teachers’ evolving needs
and technological advancements.
● Empirical research and evaluation: Future research should prior-
itize conducting more empirical studies to evaluate the effectiveness
of various professional development strategies. While current studies
largely focus on measuring improvements in teachers’ AI literacy or
capabilities after participating in professional development pro-
grammes (Celik, 2023; Chou et al., 2023, 2024; Ding, Shi, et al.,
2024; L´erias et al., 2024; Ning et al., 2024), there is a need for deeper
exploration of how these programmes transform teaching practices
(Copur-Gencturk et al., 2024; Sharma, 2024). For example, longi-
tudinal
studies
could
track
teachers
who
complete
specific
AI-focused professional development programmes, examining how
these programmes influence their teaching strategies and students’
academic performance over time. Such studies would provide valu-
able insights into the long-term impact of professional development
programmes, enabling the proposal of targeted improvements to
enhance their effectiveness (Ding, Shi, et al., 2024).
5. Conclusions
This study provides an in-depth analysis of AI in teaching and teacher
professional development through a systematic review. Of the studies
reviewed, 65% focused on the application of AI in teaching, employing
technologies such as conversational AI and related technologies, AI-
driven learning and assessment systems, immersive technologies, vi-
sual and auditory computing, and teaching and learning analytics. These
technologies were applied across various educational levels, from K-12
to higher education.
In contrast, 35% of the studies addressed AI in teacher professional
development. Within this domain, 15% examined elements and factors
influencing AI-related teacher professional development, 21% investi-
gated implementation approaches in teacher professional development,
46% explored how AI technologies can support teacher professional
development, and 18% evaluated the outcomes of teacher professional
development.
From a disciplinary perspective, AI applications in teaching spanned
diverse fields such as English, Chinese, mathematics, computer science,
natural sciences, social studies, music, special education, and more.
However, research on AI in teacher professional development was more
concentrated, primarily focusing on English, mathematics, computer
science, and education.
Regarding educational levels, research on AI in teacher professional
development was concentrated for teachers teaching in the K-12 and
higher education, while AI in teaching research also extended to include
special education, professional training and other teaching contexts.
Overall, the findings reveal an imbalance in research focus between
AI in teaching and AI in teacher professional development. Previous
studies in the AI in teaching category consistently emphasized the
importance of enhancing teachers’ AI literacy and competency, under-
scoring a pressing need for educators to develop the skills required to
effectively integrate AI into educational practices (Gaˇsevi´c et al., 2023).
The current research landscape indicates that studies on AI in teacher
professional development lag behind the practical needs of teachers
seeking to integrate AI technologies in their teaching practices. In
particular, the emergence of generative AI technologies has marked a
shift in research focus—from examining the use and effects of AI to
exploring its integration with pedagogical practices. However, within
the AI in professional development category, only a limited number of
studies have explored how to support teachers in effectively integrating
technological knowledge with pedagogical knowledge.
Therefore, there is a clear need for more research focusing on the
potential of AI in professional development, coupled with a broadening
of research perspectives. Future discussions should go beyond the
technological aspects to examine how AI technologies are applied in
education from both student learning and teacher teaching perspectives.
With the rise of the new generation of generative AI, the role of AI
technologies in supporting teacher instruction will become increasingly
significant, presenting new opportunities for research in this area. At the
same time, the growing adoption of generative AI brings ethical con-
cerns to the forefront. As these technologies become more prevalent,
addressing issues such as bias, privacy, and accountability will be
crucial. Thus, research on AI in teacher professional development should
prioritize the exploration of technological ethical issues, ensuring that
AI integration in education is both effective and responsible.
