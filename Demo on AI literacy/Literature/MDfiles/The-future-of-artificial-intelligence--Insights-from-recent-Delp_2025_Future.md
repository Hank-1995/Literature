We review thirteen Delphi studies on the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI), published between
2014 and 2024. Using the Delphi method, an iterative approach that refines expert insights
through multiple rounds, these studies provide foresight into AI’s technological advancements,
societal impacts, and policy implications across various sectors. For example, Delphi studies in
healthcare foresee significant advancements in AI-driven diagnostics and personalized medicine,
while in manufacturing, AI is anticipated to enhance human-robot collaboration and supply chain
optimization. AI’s impact on journalism and photography shows promise in automating processes
and enriching immersive storytelling, although issues like data privacy and algorithmic bias are
raised. This review emphasizes a primary focus on technology trajectories, examining anticipated
developments and timelines, while also considering broader strategic foresight aspects. General
challenges identified include equitable access, the need for robust data governance, and work-
force upskilling to integrate AI responsibly. By synthesizing insights across these studies, we
provide a structured overview of both opportunities and limitations in AI development, offering
guidance for stakeholders to navigate AI’s complexities and capitalize on its potential responsibly.
In addition, we propose methodological recommendations, such as standardizing expert selection
and diversifying perspectives to improve the quality of future Delphi studies.
1. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands at the forefront of technological innovation, revolutionizing diverse sectors and indicating a new
era in scientific advancement. Currently recognized as one of the most prominent technologies, it shares many features with other
contemporary deep technologies characterized by novelty, uncertainty, and fast growth (Gruetzemacher et al., 2021; Rotolo et al.,
2015; Tan Gonzales, 2023; Ulnicane & Erkkil¨a, 2023). Over the last decade, AI has experienced remarkable advancements and
widespread adoption, driven by breakthroughs in machine learning (ML), natural language processing, and neural networks (Kariri
et al., 2023). Due to these advancements, emerging firms specializing in AI hardware and software, such as Nvidia and Open AI, have
rapidly become among the largest and fastest-growing corporations in the world.
As these technologies rapidly evolve, there is a growing emphasis on ensuring their development aligns with public interest and
safety, highlighting the need for robust governance (Graabak et al., 2024). These advancements are deeply influencing how

information is processed and enhancing decision-making models and strategies, through the integration of big data and algorithms. In
light of AI’s rapid growth and the complexity of its potential benefits and costs, traditional forecasting methods, primarily focused on
quantitative data, may not fully capture the broader societal implications. To complement these approaches, foresight methodologies
have become increasingly valuable (Rowe & Wright, 1999). Effective foresight methods are essential as they help explore future
trends, manage the ethical and societal implications of rapid AI development, harness AI’s benefits, mitigate its risks, and ensure its
development aligns with societal values and needs (Gruetzemacher et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023; Slimi & Carballido, 2023; Weir et al.,
2024). Among these foresight tools, the Delphi method has gained prominence for its ability to systematically collect and refine expert
opinions over multiple rounds (Beiderbeck et al., 2021; Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004), making it well-suited for dealing with the un-
certainties surrounding AI.
However, the rapid pace of AI development and associated transformations has generated new social, cultural, and economic
dynamics that are difficult to anticipate (Mu˜noz, 2024). The diffusion of AI creates a “science-politics paradox”, since it requires strong
governance to reap benefits and mitigate risks but political systems struggle with this level of complexity (Pearson, 2024). Due to
institutional biases, strategic intelligence is often fragmented and undervalued, undermining its use in policymaking. Several OECD
countries are now exploring new practices to enhance the use of strategic intelligence and improve public sector capabilities (OECD,
2024). Therefore, robust foresight methods are essential for anticipating trends, addressing ethical and societal implications, helping
policymakers develop timely regulations, and assisting businesses in strategizing and investing with more confidence (Dwivedi et al.,
2023; Feng et al., 2022; Li et al., 2020).
Engaging governments and stakeholders early in the innovation process aligns AI development with societal goals, promotes in-
clusivity, responds to emerging challenges, and manages the influence of large tech companies on policy and innovation landscapes
(Mendonça et al., 2024; OECD, 2023a, 2023b). Leveraging advanced analytics and situational awareness informs national technology
strategies, while public-private partnerships address data gaps and ensure equitable technology development (NNCTA., 2023). As we
transition from an era where technology enhanced the natural to one where it begins to resemble or replace the natural (Arthur, 2009;
Mu˜noz, 2024), AI becomes increasingly politicized against the backdrop of growing geopolitical tensions. It is essential to recognize
that AI policy requires an open debate among alternative views, ideas, values, and interests, rather than being treated as an apolitical
field (Ulnicane & Erkkil¨a, 2023).
In this context, the Delphi method, wherein a group of experts participates in questionnaires across multiple rounds, stands out as a
valuable tool to support foresight efforts in AI development. Our review primarily focuses on Delphi studies exploring technology
foresight, specifically AI’s technological trajectories, rather than the broader strategic foresight aspects. While we consider studies that
discuss societal or strategic implications, our main interest lies in understanding AI’s development and potential technological ad-
vancements. We systematically review Delphi studies on AI, summarizing the findings of 13 key articles published between 2014 and
2024, identified through a systematic search process. A period of ten years was chosen to capture recent developments and trends in AI
foresight, emphasizing medium-term foresights to maintain relevance and accuracy. While the primary focus is on summarizing the
results presented in these studies, a secondary objective is to compare the methods and foresight approaches used to develop meth-
odological recommendations for future research. This approach aims to assist a wider audience (including academics, policymakers,
and foresight practitioners) in understanding the potential impacts of AI across various sectors and improving the robustness of future
Delphi studies.
2. Delphi as a foresight method
The Delphi method, initially developed by the RAND Corporation in the 1950s for military foresight, has evolved into a widely used
tool across fields such as technology, health, and policy analysis. Its structured communication process, designed to reduce bias and
refine expert opinions over multiple iterative rounds, is increasingly applied to disruptive technologies, advanced manufacturing, and
other areas (Alon et al., 2019a; Haidar et al., 2024; Landeta & Lertxundi, 2024; Leypoldt et al., 2024). This adaptability is crucial for
guiding strategic decisions in rapidly evolving sectors such as AI.
Key features of the Delphi method include participant anonymity, iterative rounds for refining views, and controlled feedback to
summarize group responses (Rowe & Wright, 1999). It starts with selecting a diverse group of experts who provide initial responses to a
questionnaire, followed by feedback and further rounds until consensus or stabilization of opinions is achieved. The iterative design
ensures that experts can reassess their judgments based on collective feedback, leading to more accurate and informed conclusions
over time (Dalkey & Helmer, 1963; Landeta et al., 2011; Turoff, 1970). By allowing experts to revise their opinions in response to new
information, the method reduces cognitive biases, such as anchoring and overconfidence, and fosters a more balanced consensus
(Lalumera, 2015; Landeta, 2006).
Delphi offers advantages such as reducing bias and incorporating diverse perspectives (Landeta & Lertxundi, 2024; Mayor et al.,
2016; Von der Gracht, 2012). The method’s flexibility allows it to address complex, multifaceted problems, especially in deep tech
domains where technological advancements and societal impacts are deeply intertwined. It combines qualitative and quantitative
approaches to provide comprehensive insights into emerging trends and future scenarios (Donohoe & Needham, 2009). In fields like
information systems, Delphi has shown strong utility in identifying trends and supporting decision-making under uncertainty. Studies
have demonstrated its effectiveness in anticipating the impacts of emerging technologies and guiding strategic decisions (Gallego &
Bueno, 2014; Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004). For instance, its application in urban and regional planning underscores its role in producing
reliable, consensus-driven insights (Linstone & Turoff, 2002). In health services research, Delphi is noted for synthesizing expert
judgment into actionable findings, especially where direct data is limited or contradictory (Hasson et al., 2000; Parente &
Anderson-Parente, 2011). In conservation and environmental management, Delphi has proven valuable for developing decision

support systems and predicting ecological impacts, demonstrating its adaptability across disciplines (Mukherjee et al., 2015).
Despite its strengths, the Delphi method has limitations, including a tendency toward over-optimism from experts due to
involvement (engagement) bias and underestimating real-world challenges (Brandes, 2009; Tichy, 2004; Winkler & Moser, 2016).
Selection bias in expert choice remains a key concern, as the definition of expertise and potential biases in expert opinions can affect
outcomes (Devaney & Henchion, 2018; Landeta et al., 2011). Additionally, the method’s reliance on consensus as a way to approx-
imate truth may not fully capture the complexity of diverse expert opinions (Landeta, 2006). Suggested improvements include
diversifying expert backgrounds and applying correction factors for optimism to mitigate overestimation and bias (Brandes, 2009).
In our review, the primary focus was on technological foresight, specifically examining AI advancements and timelines. However,
we also included studies primarily centered on strategic foresight that had a notable technological focus. Technological foresights
predict specific advancements and timelines, while strategic foresights explore broader societal, economic, and policy implications,
guiding long-term strategic planning (Eto, 2003; Leypoldt et al., 2024; Martino, 2023; Miles, 2010). Our sample integrates global and
localized perspectives, covering innovations across sectors like healthcare, manufacturing, and creative industries, contributing to our
understanding of AI’s potential evolution and its varied impacts.
3. Method
To conduct a comprehensive review of Delphi-based foresights within the AI sector, we implemented a search strategy using the
Web of Science database, specifically selecting all databases to ensure a comprehensive scope. We selected Web of Science for its high-
impact, peer-reviewed journal collection and comprehensive citation tracking, ensuring academic rigor and precision. Our search
focused specifically on AI, using the query:
TS=(Delphi) AND TS=(artificial intelligence) AND TS=(technolog*) AND (TS=(forecast) OR TS=(foresight) OR TS=(anticipat*) OR
TS=(prospect*) OR TS=(predict*) OR TS=(projecti*) OR TS=(estimat*) OR TS=(traject*)) AND PY=(2014–2024)
The query was designed to retrieve articles on Delphi studies in the AI sector with a particular emphasis on technology foresight.
This focus guided our selection of keywords. Core terms included ’Delphi’, ’artificial intelligence,’ and ‘technology’, along with
variations such as ’forecast,’ ’foresight,’ ’anticipate,’ ’prospect,’ ’predict,’ ’projection,’ ’estimate,’ and ’trajectory’ to capture future
technological trajectories. The search strategy targeted the Title, Abstract, and Keywords (TS) in the Web of Science database. The
work was conducted in August 2024, covering publications from 2014 to 2024 to ensure relevance and timeliness.
This search yielded 76 articles, and the cleaning process was conducted manually. We carefully reviewed abstracts and searched the
full text of each article to exclude those that did not meet our criteria. We excluded 63 papers, which were either not truly Delphi
studies, lacked sufficient focus on technology foresight or AI, did not describe the Delphi process adequately, or were literature re-
views. While this process involved some subjective decisions, our intent was not to provide a comprehensive view of all AI foresights.
Instead, we focused on selecting a representative sample of Delphi-based studies that clearly demonstrated how the method is used for
technological foresight in AI. This allowed us to investigate how Delphi studies frame technological foresight in AI and the insights they
generate. Nevertheless, our criteria included studies that, even if not exclusively focused on technology, incorporated significant
aspects of technological foresight. This approach allowed us to consider foresights involving policy, ethics, and other issues related to
AI. Ultimately, 13 articles met our inclusion criteria for Delphi-based foresights on AI technology. Fig. 1
As shown in Table 1, the 13 articles in the sample focus on different dimensions of AI. Four adopt a broad perspective, addressing
innovation in AI, trends, and societal transformation. Another four concentrate on healthcare, examining AI’s impact on diagnostic
accuracy, patient care improvements, and ethical issues. Two articles explore manufacturing, highlighting AI’s role in transforming
processes and societal impact. Two articles investigate the creative potential of photographic algorithms, and AI in journalism. Articles

dealing with general applications and manufacturing tend to have a more global scope, involving multinational panels of experts and
addressing worldwide trends and impacts. In contrast, studies focused on specific applications like healthcare, photography, and
journalism are more localized, centered on, or derived from particular regions or countries.
As discussed in the introduction, this study has two objectives. First, to analyze the method used in this sample of Delphi studies
that foresight AI, in order to draw methodological recommendations for future research. Second, to summarize the findings presented
in these studies with regard to the future of AI across a variety of sectors. Accordingly, our analysis focused on several critical aspects of
these studies, including objectives and outcomes, Delphi types, geographical scope, foresight time horizons, panel sizes and charac-
teristics, questionnaire types, Delphi round numbers, dropout rates, and the analytical tools employed. We also examine the inte-
gration of Delphi studies with supplementary methods such as scenario planning, in-depth personal interviews, and quantitative
analysis of demand trends. Additionally, we scrutinize panel composition, expert selection techniques, and methodologies used to
measure consensus levels.
4. Results
4.1. Methodological approach of the sampled studies
Table 2 provides a detailed methodological outline of the Delphi studies reviewed. Most studies combined qualitative and quan-
titative questions and employed multinational panels to ensure diverse perspectives. The communication methods varied, including
online platforms (e.g., Google Forms, Lime Survey), email, and video conferencing tools like Microsoft Teams or Skype, affecting
interaction dynamics and response quality. The majority also used supplementary methods such as scenario analysis and interviews to
enrich their findings, providing context and depth to the quantitative data gathered. Key distinctions among the studies lie in the
number and type of experts involved, the specific focus of their questions, and the additional methods integrated into the Delphi
process. Some studies had larger, more diverse expert panels, while others focused on highly specialized fields with fewer experts.
Tables 3–6
The reviewed articles included seven technology foresights and five strategic foresights. Technology foresights addressed specific
advancements and their timelines, focusing on AI innovations in fields such as surgical education, computational pathology, and car
manufacturing. Strategic foresights explored broader societal and policy implications, covering areas like primary care, ethical issues
in surgery, and journalism.
We distinguished between technological and strategic foresight to better understand future developments. Technological foresight
involves assessing emerging trends, probable technological advancements, and likely timelines for emerging technologies, which can
be valuable for directing research and investment strategies (Poper, 2011). Conversely, strategic foresight delves into the broader
socio-ethical and economic implications of these advancements, guiding holistic decision-making (European Commission, 2023;
OECD, 2020). Given the distinct expertise required for each approach, our study acknowledges the challenges in integrating these
perspectives within a single Delphi study. This distinction ensures that our analysis considers both real-world technological progress
and the necessary socio-ethical considerations.
Several methodological issues were inconsistently reported across the studies. For example, only two articles mentioned the
number of years of experience of the experts involved. Pilot studies were reported in five articles, where questionnaires were tested
with a small group of experts to ensure clarity. Dropout rates were discussed in only two articles, indicating a lack of consistent
reporting on participant retention throughout the Delphi process. Additionally, only one article clearly reported the rate of change in
answers between Delphi rounds. Experts’ anonymity was maintained in most studies, with only two articles revealing the experts’
identities.
The studies exhibited varied approaches concerning consensus. For instance, some studies reported a high degree of consensus
among experts, particularly in fields like healthcare and manufacturing, where there was generally more agreement on the impact and
integration of AI. In contrast, studies focusing on more abstract or future-oriented applications, such as societal transformation and
ethical implications, showed less consensus due to the inherent uncertainties and differing perspectives. However, several articles did
not report sufficient information about consensus, limiting the ability to fully understand the degree of agreement or disagreement
among the experts involved.
In sum, the lack of established quality indicators for Delphi studies further complicates the assessment of their reliability and
validity. Therefore, it seems essential to develop standardized quality indicators to enhance the consistency and robustness of Delphi
study methodologies (Landeta & Lertxundi, 2024).
4.2. Summary of AI foresights
4.2.1. General applications
One of the primary findings is that AI will significantly enhance service offerings by providing more customized and sophisticated
services. This enhancement is driven by AI’s hyper-intelligence capabilities and its convergence with other technologies like big data
and robots, thereby improving service quality in manufacturing and service industries. Big data is also anticipated to revolutionize
marketing strategies by enabling businesses to better understand and respond to customer preferences and behaviors. The techno-
logical capacity of big data combined with AI’s analytical prowess will lead to innovative marketing approaches that are more
personalized and effective (Kim & Kang, 2022).

(IDSS), among others, have the potential to act as general-purpose technologies (GPTs), transforming multiple sectors and driving
technological advancements. These subdisciplines can independently lead to significant innovations, emphasizing the transformative
power of AI across various fields (Gruetzemacher et al., 2021).
The adoption of Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSS) will enhance decision-making processes across various sectors. IDSS,
powered by advanced analytics and AI capabilities, will improve operational efficiency and strategic planning, leading to better-
informed decisions and optimized resource allocation (Skulimowski, 2014).
Competition among states and tech companies may lead to compromises being made in developing safe AI. This scenario un-
derscores the importance of implementing robust regulatory frameworks to prevent systemic risks and ensure the ethical deployment
of AI technologies (Weir et al., 2024).
Foresight into AI progress remains a challenge due to the complexity and rapid evolution of the technology. Effective foresight
requires both statistical and judgmental techniques to manage uncertainty and guide research efforts. This highlights the need for
robust methodologies to predict AI advancements accurately and develop appropriate governance frameworks. Establishing timelines
for developing and deploying transformative AI technologies is crucial. These timelines will help mitigate potential catastrophic and
existential risks associated with rapid AI advancements, ensuring that developments align with societal values and safety standards
(Gruetzemacher et al., 2021).
4.2.2. Healthcare
The integration of AI in healthcare is anticipated to bring significant advancements and challenges across various domains. AI/ML
tools are projected to greatly enhance diagnostic accuracy, particularly benefiting minority populations and those with limited access
to healthcare professionals (Blease et al., 2020). However, some experts express skepticism about AI’s ability to significantly narrow
health disparities in the following few years (Blease et al., 2020; Skulimowski, 2014). Within the next decade, AI is expected to develop
methods for immediate performance feedback and anatomy recognition in surgical images, which will revolutionize surgical education
and training (Vedula et al., 2022). AI will also enable personalized training curricula for surgeons, allowing customized learning

5. Discussion
5.1. Synthesis and contextualization of key findings
Across the domains studied, several common themes emerged, reflecting both the potential and challenges of AI. For instance,
while it is clear that technological progress in AI will transform these diverse sectors, Delphi studies highlighted various socioethical
considerations, such as bias in AI algorithms, data privacy, and the safe use of AI. These issues are prominently featured in current
debates as well, where, for example, there is a growing concern about algorithmic fairness and the need to eliminate biases that could
perpetuate social inequalities (Agarwal et al., 2023; Chen, 2023). Other common themes include the emphasis on education across
different sectors to prepare for AI integration and the focus on ethics and data governance to ensure responsible use of AI technologies
(Bouderhem, 2024; Dwivedi, 2021).
In healthcare, Delphi studies included in our review (Berbis et al., 2023; Blease et al., 2020; Ermolina & Tiberius, 2021; Lam et al.,
2021; Vedula et al., 2022) predict significant advancements in AI-driven diagnostics, personalized medicine, clinical decision-making,
and medical resource allocation, contributing to enhanced healthcare outcomes and practices. Other current studies corroborate these
predictions, highlighting the rapid adoption of AI in a number of specialties, such as radiology (Khalifa & Mona, 2024). For instance,

delivery.
Among the concerns mentioned in our review and discussed in recent literature is the crucial need for equitable access to AI
technologies (Gurevich et al., 2022). There is a risk that advanced AI tools may be accessible only to developed countries and
well-funded healthcare institutions, leading to a disparity in the quality of care between different countries, regions, and healthcare
providers (Abr`amoff, 2023; Ibrahim et al., 2021). Efforts must be made to democratize access to these technologies, ensuring that all
patients can benefit from advancements in AI. Additionally, a key aspect of integrating AI into medical practice is the need for changes
in medical curricula and training programs, as highlighted by both our review of Delphi studies and other current research (Wartman &
Combs, 2018; Wu, 2021). Healthcare professionals must be equipped with the knowledge and skills to effectively use AI tools, which
includes understanding the limitations of AI, interpreting AI-generated insights, and maintaining a critical perspective on AI-generated
recommendations. Therefore, medical education should include training on AI to prepare the next generation of healthcare providers.
The integration of AI into the manufacturing sector appears to be at the forefront of digital transformation. Our review suggests that
AI will have a significant impact on manufacturing across various levels, including supply chain optimization and enhancing human-
robot collaboration. For instance, by improving collaboration between humans and robots, AI can assist workers in tackling complex
tasks more efficiently, ultimately achieving higher production rates and innovation in the industrial sector, as also highlighted by other
studies (Arents et al., 2021). This collaboration is becoming increasingly sophisticated, with robots capable of working alongside
humans in tasks that require precision and adaptability, making the manufacturing process more flexible and responsive to changing
demands (Wang et al., 2019). Further, a review of AI applications in manufacturing operations found significant cost reductions in
manufacturing plants utilizing AI for predictive maintenance (Leonard, 2020; Plathottam et al., 2023), which aligns with earlier Delphi
predictions.
However, the transition to AI-driven manufacturing poses its own set of challenges. For instance, there is a need for substantial
investment in advanced technology and research, since AI implementation often requires significant capital expenditure on new
machinery, software, and infrastructure upgrades (Wan, 2021). Another challenge is workforce reskilling. As AI and automation
technologies evolve, there is a growing need for employees to acquire new skills and competencies. This includes not only technical
skills related to operating and maintaining AI systems but also soft skills such as problem-solving and adaptability. A recent report from
the National Association of Manufacturers (2024) shows how manufacturers are proactively upskilling their workforce to leverage AI
opportunities. For example, numerous companies are establishing training programs designed to help employees develop their skills
and confidence in using AI systems in a responsible and ethical manner such as programs focused on AI literacy and ethics, and
technical programming.
The transformative potential of AI extends beyond healthcare and manufacturing, impacting other areas such as journalism and
photography. Recent findings resonate with many of the foresights reported in the Delphi study by Tunez-Lopez et al. (2021). AI has
indeed begun to play a significant role in diverse journalism practices. For instance, automated journalism, often referred to as
algorithmic journalism, involves the use of algorithmic decision-making in news coverage as well as the automation of various
journalistic tasks, including reporting, writing, curation, and data analysis (Diakopoulos, 2015; Linden, 2016). This automation has
paved the way for personalized news consumption, with AI algorithms recommending articles based on reader preferences and be-
haviors. Immersive journalism is another practice that has emerged through AI integration and significantly evolved since its inception
in 2015, defined as the production of news that allows people to gain first-person experiences of the events or situations described in
news stories (de la Pe˜na et al., 2010). This form of journalism uses immersive techniques to enhance storytelling, producing 360◦ video
reports that often focus on social issues and provide viewers with interactive experiences. By using virtual reality headsets, audiences
can choose their angles and perspectives, transforming traditional news consumption into an immersive “storyliving” experience.
Research shows that this approach increases engagement, empathy, and credibility compared to non-immersive formats (Aitamurto
et al., 2022; Nielsen & Sheets, 2021).
Despite diverse opportunities that AI brings to the field of journalism, these technologies also present socioethical and legal
challenges related to privacy, manipulation, data biases, transparency, and the lack of international regulations governing the use of
AI, among others. Some of these concerns are raised in our review and align with findings from various studies reporting how biases in
the data used to generate a news story might threaten credibility and undermine public trust in journalism (Bastian et al., 2021). When
algorithms rely on biased datasets, the resulting news content can perpetuate stereotypes, skew narratives, and present an incomplete
picture of events (Al-Zoubi et al., 2024). This not only impacts the quality of reporting but also raises ethical questions about the
responsibility of journalists and media organizations in ensuring fairness and accuracy in their coverage. As a result, addressing data
bias and fostering transparency in AI-driven journalism are essential to maintaining the integrity of the profession.
The development and use of AI-powered tools in contemporary photography open up a vast range of possibilities for photographers
and visual artists, from simply removing unwanted objects from a photo to generating realistic images from textual descriptions.
Recent studies indicate that these technologies significantly enhance creative workflows, enabling the creation of highly realistic or
entirely novel images (Guo et al., 2024; Zeng, 2023). However, as AI continues to advance, important questions surrounding privacy,
authenticity, and the creative implications of AI in photography have emerged (Tang, 2023). For example, AI’s ability to produce
works that rival or surpass human capabilities blurs the line between human and machine-generated art, raising concerns about
originality and authenticity in artistic creation. These advancements will further complicate the discourse around copyright, attri-
bution, and the evolving nature of creativity in the digital age. In this context, it is important to critically reassess these issues to
navigate the challenges posed by AI in photography.

5.2. Methodological considerations and future directions
Most studies in our sample focus predominantly on generic issues such as regulation, ethics, and potential impacts. While these
matters are undoubtedly significant from a strategic foresight perspective, their preoccupation with broad socio-ethical considerations
can inadvertently constrain their applicability to the nuanced dynamics of technological advancements. Technological advancement,
by its nature, necessitates precise and practical consideration of its development stages, functionality, and implementation. Including
technological foresight as a foundational step is crucial; without genuine progress in technological terms, discussions about regula-
tions, ethics, and potential impacts remain theoretical. Moreover, if not realized and validated through tangible advancements,
technologies risk remaining abstract concepts with no practical applications. Thus, integrating technological foresight prior to
addressing generic issues ensures that the subsequent discussions on regulation and ethics are grounded in real-world contexts where
these technologies operate, thereby improving the relevance and usefulness of foresight studies. This integrated approach ensures that
strategic foresight is not only visionary but also actionable, addressing the practicalities of technological innovations alongside their
broader implications.
Our review has several limitations, including the exclusion of certain study types and potential biases in the selection process. Only
studies accessible through the Web of Science database were considered, potentially excluding relevant research from other sources
such as Scopus or Google Scholar. Additionally, the review primarily focused on articles that used the Delphi method, potentially
overlooking other effective foresight techniques that could provide complementary insights into AI development. Moreover, the choice
of search keywords was intentionally selective to ensure the inclusion of studies that specifically combined Delphi-based methodol-
ogies with AI technology foresight. While additional keywords could have yielded a broader range of results, we aimed to prevent an
overwhelming volume of articles, some of which might lack direct relevance to our focus on Delphi-based technological foresight for
AI.
Standardized reporting practices, rigorous methodological designs, and transparent expert selection are essential for enhancing
study reliability. Future research should explore underrepresented aspects of AI development and consider combining Delphi with
other foresight methods to improve accuracy and depth. This approach would address the complex, multifaceted nature of AI
development, ensuring insights are comprehensive and actionable.
Future Delphi studies could focus on exploring the impacts of regulations and policy development. Understanding how trans-
parency, copyright rules, risk identification, and risk mitigation will evolve and affect AI deployment is crucial. Policymakers and
stakeholders would benefit from insights into how to shape AI development and integration across various sectors. Future Delphi
studies should also prioritize the ethical implications of AI, focusing on developing frameworks that ensure fairness, transparency, and
accountability. Issues such as data privacy, bias in AI algorithms, and the ethical deployment of AI in decision-making processes are
vital areas of research. These studies can guide the creation of robust governance structures that align with societal values and ethical
standards.
While this review covered healthcare, manufacturing, photography, and journalism, other sectors such as education, energy,
transportation, and retail are also poised for significant AI-driven transformations. Future Delphi studies could examine the specific
challenges and opportunities in these sectors, providing tailored recommendations for effective AI integration and innovation. In
particular, AI’s role in energy systems, both in terms of enhancing efficiency and mitigating negative impacts, is crucial. The significant
energy and water consumption of AI technologies must be addressed, as highlighted by recent concerns about their environmental
footprint (Alfaro et al., 2018; Henderson et al., 2022). Delphi studies can explore strategies to balance AI advancements with sus-
tainable practices, ensuring AI development does not compromise environmental goals.
Moreover, conducting longitudinal Delphi studies can provide a more dynamic understanding of AI’s impact over time. Tracking
the evolution of AI technologies and their societal implications will help refine insights and adapt strategies to emerging trends and
challenges.
The findings from these Delphi studies can inform policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers, aiding in strategic planning and
decision-making amidst AI’s rapid evolution. Policies should promote ethical AI development, address data privacy concerns, and
ensure equitable access to AI technologies. Public awareness and engagement are crucial to align AI development with societal values,
maximizing benefits and mitigating risks. Robust governance frameworks and proactive policy measures are necessary to navigate AI’s
transformative potential responsibly.
6. Conclusions
Exploring the future of AI through Delphi studies offers valuable insights for policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers, aiding
in strategic planning and decision-making amid rapid technological progress. The reviewed Delphi studies emphasize AI’s trans-
formative potential, as well as the ethical, societal, and economic challenges of AI integration across sectors like healthcare,
manufacturing, journalism, and photography. To enhance the robustness and applicability of these foresights, future research should
prioritize standardized reporting practices, methodological rigor, and diversity in expert panels.
Additionally, more comprehensive studies are needed to focus on underrepresented challenges such as AI regulation, equitable
access, and interdisciplinary collaboration. While many Delphi studies have concentrated on policy and societal impacts, Delphi can
also be a valuable tool for exploring experts’ insights into where the technology itself may be headed, distinguishing realistic tra-
jectories from speculations that circulate in public, media or even policy discussions. By delving into experts’ views on AI’s technical
progress and potential, Delphi studies can suggest realistic timeframes and technological limitations.
By addressing some of the gaps discussed in this paper, Delphi studies can better navigate uncertainties and guide the responsible
