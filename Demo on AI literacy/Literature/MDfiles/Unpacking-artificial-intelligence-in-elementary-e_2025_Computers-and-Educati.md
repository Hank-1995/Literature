Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained much research interest recently and is rapidly transforming education 
around the world. However, there is still limited research with regards to its applications and effects on learning, 
in comparison to the available studies conducted at higher levels of education. This paper presents a systematic 
literature review conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) guidelines. It explores the geographical distribution and frequency of research on AI in elementary 
education between 2013 and 2023. It provides an analysis of the various educational areas in which AI has been 
applied, and it synthesizes reported benefits and challenges, culminating in recommendations for future research. 
This analysis shows a growing interest in exploring perspectives around using AI in teaching and learning, 
spotlighting, in the meantime, significant research gaps, including the long-term effects on child development, 
privacy issues, and role of the teacher in the classroom. Hence, AI’s potential to enhance educational experiences 
is evident, though more research is needed to address ethical concerns and ensure responsible implementation. 
Recommendations include further investigation into AI’s impact on student learning outcomes and teacher roles 
and the development of comprehensive ethical frameworks for AI use in schools.
1. Introduction
Early childhood and elementary education represent critical periods 
for cognitive, social, and emotional development, laying the foundation 
for lifelong learning and academic achievement. As education systems 
worldwide increasingly integrate emerging technologies, artificial in-
telligence (AI) has begun to reshape learning environments by offering 
adaptive instruction, real-time feedback, and personalized learning 
pathways. While AI’s influence has been widely studied in secondary 
and higher education contexts, its application in elementary classrooms, 
where developmental sensitivities and pedagogical needs differ mark-
edly, remains underexplored. This intersection presents both a pressing 
opportunity and a research imperative: to better understand how AI can 
ethically and effectively support learners in the foundational years of 
formal education.
This education stage lays the cognitive and social groundwork for 
lifelong learning, and novel technologies like AI promise to transform 
how we cultivate these foundational skills. High-quality early education 
environments that seamlessly integrate engaging learning experiences 
are essential in fostering the skills necessary for children’s holistic 
development (Polonsky & Rotman, 2023). Initially, educational tech-
nology was limited to using computers for simple tasks like teaching, 
researching, and managing resources (Schindler et al., 2017), but in the 
past decade, AI has rapidly advanced to become more pervasive glob-
ally; its influence on personal and professional lives is growing signifi-
cantly. AI systems, designed to mimic human intelligence, have evolved 
into sophisticated tools that personalize learning, adapt to individual 
needs, and provide real-time feedback, making education more inter-
active and tailored to students’ unique learning profiles (Chassignol 
et al., 2018).
Although previous reviews have offered comprehensive syntheses of 
AI applications in education, their focus has predominantly been on 
general education, secondary education, and higher education, leaving a 
notable gap in the literature concerning grades K–6. This gap has grown 
increasingly urgent in the wake of the post-2020 proliferation of AI 
tools, including generative models and adaptive learning platforms, 
which are now being piloted and deployed in elementary contexts 
without sufficient empirical validation or pedagogical alignment. 
Recent studies by U˘gras¸, U˘gras¸, Papadakis, and Kalogiannakis (2024a, 
2024b) and U˘gras¸ et al. (2024a, 2024b) further convey this urgency by

examining teacher experiences with Chat GPT in early STEM and pri-
mary education, respectively. They report perceived benefits such as 
personalized feedback, enhanced creativity, and alignment with sus-
tainable education goals (SDG 4), but also document concerns over 
misinformation, data security, and a lack of pedagogical support. Such 
findings highlight the need for a systematic synthesis of empirical 
trends, pedagogical implications, and ethical considerations in AI’s use 
in early education.
Crucially, the findings offer tailored guidance to key stakeholders: 
educators can use the insights to scaffold AI literacy and adapt instruc-
tion to emerging digital modalities; curriculum designers can embed 
empirically grounded AI tools aligned with developmental needs and 
equity principles; and policymakers are better positioned to regulate 
early AI adoption, promote responsible innovation, and allocate re-
sources for teacher professional development. In this way, the review 
both strengthens the theoretical grounding of educational AI and 
translates synthesis into actionable strategies for ethical, age- 
appropriate implementation in elementary classrooms. To better un-
derstand how AI technologies influence early learning, it is essential to 
draw on well-established learning theories. Constructivist frameworks 
(Piaget, 1952; Vygotsky, 1980) emphasize that children actively 
construct knowledge through interaction with their environment, prin-
ciples that closely align with the interactive, learner-centered design of 
many AI-based educational tools. Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory, 
especially the concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), 
underscores the role of guided learning, which is mirrored in the 
adaptive, feedback-rich features of AI systems. These tools often func-
tion as digital scaffolds (Wood, Bruner, & Ross, 1976), dynamically 
adjusting support to meet learners’ evolving needs.
Undertaking a PRISMA-guided systematic review of AI in elementary 
education comes as a research method for this paper to contribute to the 
field in three key dimensions. First, it consolidates a decade of empirical 
studies (2013–2023) into a coherent evidence base, identifying recur-
ring pedagogical patterns such as the efficacy of intelligent tutoring 
systems (ITS) in mathematics (Shih et al., 2023) and the motivational 
benefits of social robots (Neumann, 2019), while also pointing to 
widespread methodological limitations, including the prevalence of 
small-sample studies and limited experimental diversity (Liu, 2022). 
Second, it delineates critical knowledge boundaries, mapping estab-
lished domains such as AI-driven personalized learning, while exposing 
persistent gaps in areas like longitudinal socio-emotional outcomes, 
culturally responsive data privacy frameworks (Luo et al., 2023), and 
the underrepresentation of teacher–AI collaboration models. Third, the 
review highlights notable geographic clustering in study settings, 
alongside emerging technological trends and ethical tensions related to 
early AI adoption.
A systematic review specifically targeting AI applications within this 
crucial phase of education is needed to address this gap. Moore et al. 
(2023) highlight the potential of artificial intelligence tools in enhancing 
developmental skills in early childhood learning; nonetheless, they also 
note a lack of studies that target specific skills in young learners. Xu and 
Ouyang (2022) describe the wide impact of AI in STEM learning but do 
not investigate the specific implications in elementary education. 
Similarly, Guo et al. (2024) point out the need for specific studies in 
different learning environments, including the elementary grades. These 
recommendations confirm the importance of investigating AI applica-
tions at the elementary level to provide tailored insights for educators, 
policymakers, and researchers. This review offers a thematic analysis of 
AI applications and provides an overview of the current research land-
scape and a comprehensive analysis by targeting studies published be-
tween 2013 and 2023. Specifically, this review aims to: 
• Map the geographical and chronological distribution of AI research 
in elementary settings (2013–2023).
• Identify and synthesize key application domains and emerging the-
matic trends.
• Assess reported benefits, challenges, and ethical concerns to chart 
directions for future practice and policy.
With these aims in hand, we next situate our contribution within 
existing systematic reviews.
2. Related systematic reviews
Although systematic reviews on this topic are still limited, they 
predominantly highlight AI’s impact on higher education with 
increasing awareness of its potential in K-12 settings. Research from 
leading countries such as China, the United States, India, Spain, and 
Germany has been instrumental in exploring AI’s role in education (Guo 
et al., 2024; Xu & Ouyang, 2022). Previous systematic reviews explored 
AI in education, and some of the most common themes are AI in STEM 
education, AI applications and tools, and ethical concerns and chal-
lenges, which are discussed below.
2.1. AI integration in STEM education
Recent literature has investigated the integration of AI in K-12 ed-
ucation for its transformative effect and diversity of applications. One of 
the most common themes in the research of AI in education is its inte-
gration into STEM education. Xu and Ouyang (2022) found that various 
AI applications have emerged to document evidence of the significant 
effects of AI on STEM education. This view was confirmed by Ouyang 
and colleagues (2022), who associated AI-driven assessments with 
effective assessment performance for STEM subjects and concluded that 
AI-driven assessment functions improved learning experiences and 
increased academic performance and the quality of instruction. On its 
part, Guo and colleagues (2024) reiterated that general research trends 
in the application of AI to education aim at the sphere of STEM subjects, 
further emphasizing how AI can empower an improvement in educa-
tional outcomes. However, there are still challenges. As pointed out by 
Humble and Mozelius (2022), even if AI has shown significant impact in 
both STEM and language learning, issues such as biased data and poorly 
developed integration with theories of pedagogical remain major chal-
lenges. This points out the double-edged nature of AI in K-12 education, 
where this potential to revolutionize learning is usually tempered with 
practical and ethical challenges that must be addressed for a better 
understanding of its benefits and potential drawbacks.
2.2. AI applications and tools
Some reviews on AI applications in education highlight the role of AI 
in increasing the efficiency of teaching and learning processes. As Zafari 
et al. (2022) explain, in their content analysis of AI in K-12 education, 
the effect of AI applications at the level of elementary education usually 
focuses on teaching methods and performance evaluation tools. At the 
higher levels, more sophisticated analysis tools are prominent. Bue-
no-Rocha et al. (2023) consider AI-based tools in the context of early 
childhood education to have their place in advancing digital accessi-
bility and individualizing learning processes. AI tools include profi-
ling/predictive assessment systems, adaptive/personalization systems 
which are often embedded in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) or 
AI-powered tutoring systems (Bond et al., 2024; Zawacki-Richter et al., 
2019), which are designed to facilitate the process of teaching, learning, 
and evaluation in the sense that learners’ needs are considered in the 
design and delivery of educational content for better achievement of 
learning outcomes. This reveals how AI applications can make a sig-
nificant contribution to the improvement of k-12 and higher education if 
designed and implemented ethically. That said, the emphasis on teach-
ing methods in K-12 education doesn’t address how AI impacts specific 
learning aspects in K-6. This gap highlights the need for further research 
to explore AI use in elementary education.

2.3. Challenges and ethical considerations
Although the integration of AI in education brings substantial op-
portunities, there is a consensus about significant ethical challenges. 
Ethical concerns in k-12 education, especially concerning learning an-
alytics and computer vision have been highlighted in previous work in 
which researchers call for a multidisciplinary approach toward meeting 
these challenges and making accurate assessments of the potential 
benefits of AI; ethical concerns about the evolving role of teachers and 
data protection must be taken seriously (Crescenzi-Lanna, 2023; 
Humble & Mozelius, 2022). Bueno-Rocha et al. (2023) further build on 
these ethical concerns through a focus on AI’s potential for improving 
digital accessibility and inclusion in childhood education; they call for 
responsible use to avoid furthering bias already present. Bias and other 
unethical practices could merge because of unfamiliarity, lack of 
knowledge, and accessibility issues which are argued to be major bar-
riers that may hinder the proper use of AI (Benvenuti et al., 2023). 
Alhazmi et al. (2023) also warn that AI benefits are currently more 
accessible in developed countries, reiterating that ethical issues and 
concerns must be addressed so that AI has an equitable and effective 
integration into different educational settings. There is, hence, a general 
perception that even if AI may hold great promise to transform educa-
tional practice, its implementation must be managed in such a way that 
ethical concerns are considered, and equity of access is guaranteed. 
Much of this research focused on higher education and secondary/high 
school, with limited attention given to elementary education.
Previous systematic reviews explored AI’s integration in STEM ed-
ucation and highlighted its potential to enhance learning outcomes, 
though challenges like biased data and ethical concerns persist. AI 
technologies in education promise personalizing learning, yet more 
research is needed to understand their impact on early education. 
Ethical concerns and challenges have been expressed, especially 
regarding data privacy and equitable access, and reported to be crucial 
for AI’s responsible implementation across educational settings. Because 
these reviews have mainly addressed AI in education in general or 
focused on higher education or K-12 education indicates a gap in 
knowledge regarding specific phases such as elementary education. To 
fill this gap, this review will focus on elementary education (k-6) and is 
guided by the following research questions: 
● RQ1: What is the geographical distribution of research papers on AI 
applications in elementary education between 2013 and 2023?
● RQ2: How has the frequency of publications on AI applications in 
elementary education evolved between 2013 and 2023?
● RQ3: What areas and themes of elementary education have been 
explored in research related to AI technologies over the past decade?
3. Methodology
This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and repli-
cable analysis of AI applications in elementary education from the past 
decade (2013–2023). As a secondary research study, it does not involve 
the collection of primary data. Instead, it synthesizes existing literature 
to identify patterns, trends, and gaps in the field. The review follows the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) guidelines to ensure methodological rigor, transparency, 
and reproducibility.
3.1. Search methodology
The literature search was conducted across six reputable online da-
tabases: Science Direct, ERIC, JSTOR, Taylor & Francis Online, Pro-
Quest, and Scopus. These databases were selected due to their extensive 
collection of peer-reviewed educational research. The search focused 
exclusively on English-language publications. To ensure thoroughness, 
we independently performed the search using Boolean operators and 
tailored strategies to align with each database’s specific functionalities. 
Appendix A presents the research protocol including research terms and 
conditions for every database.
3.2. Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Articles were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, detailed in Table 1. The criteria emphasized peer-reviewed 
studies published between 2013 and 2023 that examined AI applica-
tions in elementary education (K-6). Studies were excluded if they did 
not focus on AI in elementary education, or if they were not peer- 
reviewed. The inclusion process was guided by a review protocol 
developed in accordance with the PRISMA checklist, ensuring consistent 
application of criteria across all stages (see Fig. 1).
3.3. Identification and screening of relevant publications
In the initial phase of the study, we independently reviewed the titles 
and abstracts of articles to determine their eligibility for inclusion. 
Following this, full texts of potentially relevant studies were obtained 
and subjected to a thorough screening process for final selection. We 
also used a quality assessment checklist to further evaluate the validity 
of all studies included in the analysis. The checklist, which was adapted 
from previous systematic literature reviews (Deng & Yu, 2022; Hamash 
et al., 2024), helped exclude 5 selected studies after the screening phase 
for not meeting the quality criteria (see Appendix B). Any disagreements 
that arose during this process were resolved through consensus, with the 
researchers regularly discussing the rationale for including or excluding 
specific articles. To assess the consistency of their decisions, Cohen’s 
kappa (κ), a measure of inter-rater reliability introduced by Cohen 
(1960), was applied. The resulting κ value of 0.751 reflected a high level 
of agreement in the coding of article inclusion and exclusion.
4. Results
4.1. Overview of the analyzed studies
The final number of the included studies was 80 which addressed AI 
in elementary education, the analysis of which reveals a strong focus on 
enhancing AI education (as a subject matter), personalized and adaptive 
education, language/literacy education, Intelligent Tutoring Systems 
(ITS), and mathematics. This prioritization indicates their significant 
impact on individualized learning experiences, critical skill develop-
ment, and the integration of emerging technologies in the curriculum. 
Personalized education and ITS are particularly emphasized for their 
ability to tailor learning to individual needs, while language/literacy 
and mathematics are explored for their foundational role in early edu-
cation. The widespread interest in AI education highlights the impor-
tance of preparing young learners to navigate and understand AI 
technologies.

Research output has witnessed a gradual increase in the past decade, 
with a noticeable surge in publications beginning in 2020. As shown in 
Fig. 2, the number of papers published annually between 2013 and 2018 
remained relatively low, with 1–3 papers per year. A noticeable growth 
begins in 2019, with 2 papers, followed by a significant increase in 2020 
with 5 papers. The upward trend continues sharply, with 10 papers in 
2021, 25 in 2022, and peaking at 28 papers in 2023. This trend reflects a 
growing interest and emphasis on AI in elementary education in recent 
years.
4.2. The geographical distribution of studies on AI in elementary 
education
The geographical distribution of the 80 research papers reveals a 
notable regional variation in the origin of studies; there is a dominant 
presence of research from Asia, contributing 56 % of the total publica-
tions, with 45 papers. Europe follows with 21 % (17 papers), while 
North America represents 16 % (13 papers). Australia and South 
America contributed relatively smaller shares, with Australia producing 
4 % (3 papers) and South America contributing 3 % (2 papers). This 
regional breakdown highlights Asia as the leading source of research in 
this dataset, while the contributions from other regions are notably 
lower (see Fig. 3).
More specifically, the data also indicate that China is the leading 
contributor with 28 % of the papers with 22 publications. The USA 
followed with 15 % (12 papers), and South Korea and Taiwan1 
contributed 10 % (8 papers) and 5 % (4 papers), respectively. The 
remaining countries each contributed between 1 % and 3 % to the 
overall dataset (see Fig. 3). In this respect, although the research output 
at a regional level seems to balance out at a macro level, there is a clear 
discrepancy at the country level. The most contributions emanate from 
China and the USA, most especially come with the most comprehensive 
understandings, which highlights the need for more diverse perspectives 
to achieve a more diverse contextual understanding of the collective 
findings. The findings of this study are presented in the matrix below, 
followed by a descriptive analysis for each thematic category.

4.4. Theme 1: perspective on AI in elementary education
4.4.1. AI meaning and AI education
Exploring how children define AI reveals that integrating formal AI 
literacy into elementary education is essential, as informal learning 
alone is insufficient for a comprehensive understanding of AI and its 
implications (Fan & Zhong, 2022). Despite positive attitudes toward AI, 
Shanghai primary school teachers face challenges, including limited 
knowledge and a need for professional training to implement AI 
curricula effectively (Han, 2021). As a matter of fact, strong digital lit-
eracy and self-efficacy among pre-service teachers are positively corre-
lated with favorable attitudes toward AI education which is indicative of 
the importance of enhancing these skills to prepare future educators 
(Lim, 2023). Investigating conceptions of AI among elementary students 
and teachers reveals that while students associate AI with programming 
and robotics, teachers are often surprised by students’ knowledge and 
concerned about their own preparedness, suggesting that AI education 
should begin with ethical considerations to build teacher confidence 
(Ottenbreit-Leftwich et al., 2022).
4.4.2. Personalized/adaptive/precision teaching/learning/education
The analysis of AI-driven adaptive technologies in differentiated 
instruction highlights significant benefits, particularly in enhancing 
individualized instruction and supporting formative assessment, 
contributing to a more inclusive learning environment. Studies 
emphasize that these technologies should supplement, not replace, 
traditional teaching methods to ensure they enhance foundational 
educational elements in areas like spelling, phonetics, and mathematics 
(Gadanidis, 2017; Johler & Krumsvik, 2022). Evaluating the Taiwanese 
Adaptive Learning Platform (TALP) in an elementary school, Liu (2022)
notes its potential to boost student motivation and identify learning 
gaps, though quantitative data did not show significant improvements 
due to limitations such as small sample size and non-standardized tests. 
The study advocates for further research using standardized measures to 
better assess the impact of precision education technologies.
4.4.3. Ethics and moral considerations regarding AI applications
Despite positive perceptions from teachers, parents, and policy-
makers, Smakman et al. (2021) stress the need for clear ethical guide-
lines for the use of social robots in education. The study advocates robust 
frameworks to ensure responsible implementation and mitigation of 
challenges. Speaking of which, Luo et al. (2023) identify challenges in 
accessibility, affordability, and social justice, and recommend that 
Chat GPT, as a conversational agent in early childhood education, should 
enhance, not replace, human educators. The study suggests shifting the 
focus from knowledge retrieval to human agency and inquiry skills. 
Samuelsson (2023) explored preschoolers’ interactions with robots and 
concluded that achieving a balanced understanding of AI’s impact on 
future generations requires including children’s perspectives in ethical 
discussions. Speaking of which, Alhashmi et al. (2021) explored 
elementary pre-service teachers’ perspectives regarding using human-
oids as teaching assistants and found that their opinions ranged from 
positive and supportive of the idea to concerned and skeptical about AI’s 
potential. They stressed that more research is needed to learn about the 
ethical considerations and impact of the teachers’ role not to be dele-
gated to robots.
4.5. Theme 2: curriculum design and development
4.5.1. AI education
The analysis of AI curriculum design in education in 9 studies reveals 
a consensus on the importance of early AI literacy and the use of 
interactive technologies. Advocacy for culturally responsive, hands-on 
learning models, such as the ’AI for Kids’ curriculum (Yang, 2022), 
along with the use of social robots and problem-based learning, em-
phasizes the importance of early AI education (Su and Zhong, 2022). 
More interactive technologies, such as Augmented Reality and tailored 
teaching materials for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are found 
effective in enhancing AI learning (Hwang et al., 2022; Zhou & Li, 
2021). This is also supported by Kim et al. (2022) and Kerneˇza (2023)
who stress the need for adaptable, user-friendly AI curricula that can be 
personalized through tools like chatbots. Meanwhile, Jang et al. (2022)
focus on enhancing engagement and problem-solving skills, highlighting 
STEM-based AI programs. Lin et al. (2021) address motivational factors 
and gender differences, while Kandlhofer et al. (2016) explore the 
feasibility of introducing AI concepts playfully, stressing the connection 
between basic AI concepts and real-world applications. However, scaf-
folding for teachers to ensure effective AI curriculum implementation is 
key 
for 
a 
successful 
implementation 
of 
AI 
curriculum 
(Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2022). These studies collectively emphasize the 
need for innovative, adaptive, and inclusive AI curriculum designs to 
teach AI literacy and concepts as a subject area.
4.5.2. Subject areas and thinking skills
In addition to developing AI literacy curricula, AI is also found to 
enhance thinking skills and professional teacher skills. For example, 
Kerneˇza (2023) identifies fundamental cognitive skills as essential for 
teachers to effectively use chatbots in designing curriculum which dis-
tinguishes self-assessment from evaluator-based assessment for the same 
abilities. With respect to students’ skills, Jang et al. (2022) exemplify

that a STEM-based AI education program considerably improves crea-
tive problem-solving skills, AI literacy, and attitude toward AI in K-6 
students whereas real-life educational experiences include AI. Further-
more, Chalmers et al. (2022) investigated the use of humanoid robots 
across a range of subjects, which reveals that robots improve engage-
ment with the curriculum and epitomize a social constructivist approach 
to teaching; if technical glitches sometimes get frustrating for students, 
this suggests that in the future, AI and robotics in education require 
further research.
4.6. Theme 3: teaching and learning
The thematic analysis reveals 3, among the 80 reviewed, studies that 
addressed “teaching and learning” as a dual objective in connection to AI 
application; most studies that addressed teaching and learning were 
particularly focused on either teaching or learning, the results of which 
are presented in 4.7. and 4.8 below. These studies illustrate how AI 
agents and robots are effectively employed to enhance teaching and 
learning, from personalized tutoring and language acquisition to 
constructive play across different educational contexts. For example, 
Shih et al. (2023) developed a dialogue-based ITS that significantly 
enhanced struggling sixth graders’ performance in multiplication and 
division of fractions. This ITS uses conversational agents to provide 
personalized support that proves the efficacy of AI in individualized 
math instruction. Similarly, Neumann (2019) reviewed the potential of 
social robots in early childhood education and argues for their potential 
to support language and literacy development for children from birth to 
age 8 years. Although this review recognizes a need for further research 
on the impact of these robots compared to human teachers, it un-
derscores their emerging role in fostering early educational engagement, 
particularly with AI tools. It is for this reason that Fridin (2014) exam-
ined the Kind SAR robot, which used storytelling as a tool for construc-
tive learning in preschool education, and reported its positive impact on 
language, cognitive, and motor skills. The dual role of AI robots as 
teachers and their impact on learning is worth exploring further; hence, 
the following section presents results on how AI applications specifically 
address teaching methodologies.
4.7. Theme 4: teaching
4.7.1. AI education
AI literacy emerges as a prominent subject area, and the potential of 
AI to improve teaching practices is becoming more widely acknowl-
edged. Despite the lack of curriculum research and limited AI tools, a 
visual interface that uses a Use-Modify-Create scaffolding approach 
effectively supported students’ understanding of AI planning and facil-
itated the learning of algorithm, pattern, and abstraction concepts 
within AI principles (Park et al., 2022; Malallah et al., 2023). Practical 
approaches to support AI education are further explored by Dai et al. 
(2023, 2024), who recommend the use of embodied, analogical, and 
disruptive approaches (EAD), which helps in human–AI comparison 
through analogical teaching and embodied interaction, to enhance stu-
dents’ understanding and knowledge of AI technology. Technologies, 
such as chatbots and ITS, have significant advantages in terms of 
customizing learning experiences and enabling more efficient teaching 
approaches. According to Aydin et al. (2022), AI tools can significantly 
complement curriculum delivery, as they are seamlessly adapted across 
subjects, which in turn improves student engagement and education 
outcomes. In this respect, Yetisensoy and Rapoport (2023) further 
establish how social studies educators can use chatbots to teach 
advanced AI concepts as a major way of building digital literacy across 
subject areas at an early age.
4.7.2. AI in teaching subject areas
Using AI technologies in teaching subject areas is cited in many 
studies, and one of the most explored scopes is language and literacy 
education. Jeon (2023) and Neumann et al. (2023), for instance, explore 
how AI tools can enhance language instruction by providing interactive 
and adaptive learning experiences that support literacy development in 
elementary school students, and Liu and Lu (2023) further emphasize 
the role of AI in fostering critical thinking and motivation in language 
education. However, Siebert et al. (2019) raise ethical considerations 
regarding the use of AI chatbots in language education by strongly 
recommending careful implementation to ensure that these technologies 
support rather than replace human educators. Mathematics is another 
subject that has gained experimental interest using ML-enhanced robots 
that socially interact with children and provide personalized learning 
and adaptive feedback (Duji´c Rodi´c et al., 2023; So & Lee, 2023). Not far 
from mathematics, Jiang et al. (2023) address the application of AI in 
financial literacy and demonstrate how social robots can effectively 
teach financial concepts while enhancing student engagement. Although 
the number of studies is inconclusive, these studies collectively indicate 
trending interest in using AI in certain subjects which makes investi-
gating the reasons behind such choices a valid point for further research.
4.7.3. ITS, personalized learning, SEN, and automation
The integration of ITS, personalized learning, and automation in 
elementary education has demonstrated significant advancements in 
providing tailored and efficient learning experiences even though the 
research is still in its infancy stage considering the number of conducted 
studies in the past decade. Zhang and Liu (2024) and Alobaidi et al. 
(2015) underscore the effectiveness of ITS in adapting instructional 
content to individual student needs with conversational agents and 
speech recognition technology. This adaptive and personalized 
approach is particularly beneficial for students with diverse learning 
profiles, as it allows the system to modify the difficulty of tasks and 
provide immediate feedback based on the student’s performance. This is 
particularly important for teaching students for students with special 
educational needs (SEN) who need accommodations that cater to their 
individual needs by adjusting content delivery to match their unique 
learning pace and abilities (Guti´errez, 2022; Jauhiainen & Guerra, 2023; 
Prentzas, 2013). Chang et al.’s (2023) usage of chatbots, which provide 
customized assistance during inquiry-based activities, further demon-
strates how AI may promote individualized science teaching. On the 
other hand, and even though automation is one of the most sought-after 
features of AI, only one study was identified to explore this topic. Ac-
cording to Sperling et al. (2022), automation can help streamline 
educational procedures and increase teaching efficiency by automating 
repetitive educational tasks and assessments for personalized education. 
This emphasizes the critical role of AI automation in enhancing 
personalized learning experiences for better engagement and educa-
tional outcomes.
4.7.4. AI to enhance educational outcomes and motivation
The application of AI in elementary education has shown promising 
results in enhancing critical thinking, collaboration skills, and 
increasing student motivation. AI-driven educational tools, particularly 
those that incorporate Capsule Networks (Caps Net), ANN, and computer 
vision were found to improve students’ critical thinking skills. These 
tools not only allow for deeper engagement with learning materials but 
also teach students to think critically by analyzing and applying infor-
mation in more complex manners (Liu & Lu, 2023). In terms of collab-
oration, Liang et al. (2021) emphasize the effectiveness of AI algorithms 
in improving group dynamics and student engagement during collabo-
rative activities. Such AI algorithms use student profiles, achievement 
data, and other learning data points to create more effective groups 
which consequently increase positive interactions among students and 
their engagement. Motivation, a critical drive for engagement in 
learning activities, is significantly enhanced using AI technologies 
including educational robots like Pepper by making learning more 
interactive and enjoyable (Liu & Lu, 2023; Schiffer & Ferrein, 2018). 
The collective impact of engaging content, individualized feedback, and

collaborative opportunities offered by AI systems has been found to 
greatly increase students’ motivation to participate in collaborative 
activities which improves critical thinking skills, but teachers need to be 
capable of incorporating such technologies in their classrooms.
4.7.5. Training and professional development
Considering the novel nature of leveraging AI potential in improving 
teaching practices, training, and professional development has emerged 
as a vital area of focus, particularly in preparing educators to meet the 
demands of using AI in elementary education. AI-driven professional 
development programs offer personalized learning experiences and 
leverage data analytics to align training sessions with individual 
teachers’ needs in a way that fosters continuous growth, ensuring that 
they remain updated with contemporary teaching methodologies and 
technologies (Lee & Yeo, 2022; Wei et al., 2020). This is further sup-
ported by Meng et al. (2022) who point out the need for integrating AI 
education into preschool training programs arguing that future educa-
tors must be equipped with the skills to incorporate AI tools into their 
teaching practices effectively. This focus on AI in professional devel-
opment not only enhances educators’ competencies but also prepares 
them to create more engaging and personalized learning environments 
for their students. As training and development continue to evolve, the 
emphasis naturally shifts towards the application of AI in enhancing 
learning outcomes, which is the focus of the subsequent discussion.
4.8. Theme 5: learning
4.8.1. Enquiry literacy and thinking skills
The exploration of inquiry literacy and thinking skills in elementary 
education has highlighted several significant findings across multiple 
studies. AI-interfaced robotic toys, for instance, significantly enhance 
inquiry skills by fostering higher-order thinking, creativity, and collab-
orative skills, while various educational interventions have been shown 
to effectively develop cognitive abilities in children through targeted 
approaches (Keren & Fridin, 2014; Mengting et al., 2020; Kewalramani 
& Kidman, 2021). In the same vein, AI-driven tools like Xiao Ling and 
Alcody, combined with STEM teaching and teaching of AI skills, 
significantly enhance students’ expression, questioning, and geometric 
thinking abilities and metacognitive task performance (Li et al., 2023; 
Morales-Urrutia et al., 2020).
4.8.2. AI education
AI education in elementary settings has been explored with a focus 
on enhancing children’s understanding and conceptualization of AI 
which has been found to significantly enhance learning experiences and 
outcomes. Research suggests that critical ML educational programs not 
only deepen children’s understanding of AI concepts but also create 
reciprocal learning environments where young children often lead and 
enhance learning experiences (Irgens et al., 2022; Vartiainen et al., 
2020). This is further confirmed by Yang et al. (2023) who demonstrate 
how technology-enhanced embodied learning activities in kindergartens 
promote AI literacy among young children. Their study shows that in-
teractions with intelligent agents facilitate children’s understanding of 
AI principles and support multimodal learning. The effectiveness of 
incorporating AI education into early childhood is, hence, evident and 
indicative of its potential to enhance conceptual knowledge, foster 
interactive learning experiences, and promote a foundational under-
standing of AI, but this does not assume a positive impact on learning in 
other subject areas such as language development and more research is 
needed for this purpose.
4.8.3. Language/literacy education & reading comprehension
Language and literacy education has shown notable improvements in 
various aspects of reading and language development with the use of AI. 
Xu et al. (2021, 2022), for instance, provide evidence that AI-enhanced 
tools can significantly boost reading comprehension by engaging 
students in interactive and adaptive reading experiences. AI-driven 
educational interventions using artificial neural networks have shown 
evidence of improving reading comprehension, reading inter-
est/motivation through personalized learning experiences (Liu et al., 
2022; Martínez-Ram´on & Gil, 2023; Wang et al., 2023). Hong et al.’s 
(2016) framework, Robot-Assisted Language Learning (RALL) supports 
this by showing that robot-assisted instruction can enhance language 
skills, particularly in receptive skills like listening and reading. 
Elementary language education can also benefit from incorporating 
gamification and intelligent adaptation into mobile learning applica-
tions which also improve learning outcomes and motivation (Sandberg 
et al., 2014). If AI can help improve language learning outcomes, which 
are essential to learning other skills, at the elementary level, it may also 
help with other subjects like mathematics.
4.8.4. Mathematics
Mathematics emerges as a key subtheme in exploring the impact of 
AI on learning outcomes as research shows significant advancements in 
enhancing student achievement and engagement. Although details of 
the AI technology are not specified in Alomari and Jabr’s (2020)
experiment, they found that AI-based educational software notably 
improved second-grade students’ mathematics achievement and atti-
tudes towards the subject. A meta-analysis by Hwang (2022) demon-
strates that AI applications significantly enhance elementary students’ 
mathematics achievement, although the impact varies depending on the 
duration and topic of the intervention which requires strategic and 
careful implementation. AI applications can also be incorporated into 
ITS to teach mathematics by improving teacher effectiveness and 
increasing parental involvement, particularly during disruptions like the 
COVID-19 pandemic (Et, 2021; Hwang, 2022).
4.9. Theme 6: assessment
Using AI for assessment in elementary education has shown signifi-
cant interest, though on different concerns of assessments, particularly 
predictive analytics and personalized learning. AI-enhanced predictive 
analytics were found to be effective, as evidenced by the integration of 
sociodemographic and EEG data to enhance early school failure pre-
dictions and the use of AI models to predict learning styles for tailored 
recommendations for personalized learning (Pardamean et al., 2022; 
Rasheed et al., 2021). To support personalized learning, Hoskins et al. 
(2021) present the Carolina Automated Reading Evaluation (CARE), 
which aligns well with traditional reading assessments, sharing their 
findings of its potential for effective screening for reading challenges. 
Chu et al. (2015)
introduce a relatively similar model, the 
Model-Tracing Intelligent Tutor (MIT), which offers detailed tracking 
and diagnostics for mathematical problem-solving. However, such 
findings are still limited to specific subjects and skills, and the need for 
robust evaluation frameworks to improve predictive assessment for 
other subjects like digital and STEM education is necessary, alongside 
the effective use of cognitive knowledge representation models to assess 
reasoning levels and support personalized learning (Huang, 2022; Sri-
vani & Murugappan, 2023).
4.10. Challenges and gaps in AI integration
The thematic analysis of the data reveals many challenges regarding 
the integration of AI in elementary education, particularly concerning 
teacher preparedness and ethical considerations. Wide gaps are identi-
fied in AI literacy among students and limited AI knowledge and re-
sources among Chinese elementary school teachers (Fan & Zhong, 2022) 
and Han (2021), which is why this issue extends to the need for struc-
tured professional development and training as noted by Wang et al. 
(2023) that teacher readiness for AI is critical but often insufficient. It is 
insufficient because robust policies and ethical guidelines are still 
needed to ensure the effective implementation of tools like social robots 
T. Boulhrir and M. Hamash                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Computers and Education: Artiϧcial Intelligence 9 (2025) 100442 

--- Page 10 ---

(Smakman et al., 2021). Hence, addressing moral considerations, 
despite positive stakeholder perspectives and research findings, is 
crucial considering the limitations of most research that range from 
small sample sizes in ITS platforms to non-standardized tests, which 
hamper the validity and reliability of data (Liu, 2022). Another major 
challenge was discussed by Luo et al. (2023) who expressed concerns 
regarding the accessibility and affordability of using generative AI in 
early childhood education and emphasized that AI should enhance 
rather than replace teachers.
The findings indicate significant gaps in the integration of AI in 
elementary education, particularly in teacher readiness and ethical 
considerations. To begin with, 28 out of the 80 studies reviewed did not 
specify the AI technology involved and addressed AI in general terms, 
which limits the ability to assess the effectiveness and understand the 
implications and challenges of specific AI tools. There is a clear emphasis 
on AI literacy initiatives, but little is known about the utility of such 
programs, especially with the lack of knowledge among educators (Fan 
& Zhong, 2022; Han, 2021). Structured professional development and 
training are crucial, as teacher readiness for AI is often insufficient, 
partly due to the absence of robust policies and ethical guidelines (Wang 
et al., 2023). The results also underscore the importance of addressing 
small sample sizes and non-standardized tests in studies on Intelligent 
Tutoring Systems (ITS) and other AI platforms, as these factors under-
mine the validity and reliability of the data (Liu, 2022). Concerns about 
the accessibility and affordability of generative AI tools were also raised 
with potential risks that these technologies might replace rather than 
enhance the role of teachers in early childhood education (Luo et al., 
2023). Challenges in curriculum design and the creation of culturally 
responsive curricula require further exploration (Kerneˇza, 2023; Yang, 
2022; Zhou & Li, 2021).
5. Discussion
5.1. Summary of AI integration in elementary education
The analysis reveals several key insights into the current state of AI 
integration in elementary education. While machine learning (ML), 
chatbots, and robots are prominently explored across various studies (e. 
g., Chalmers et al., 2022; Rasheed et al., 2021; Yang, 2022), a significant 
portion of the research, specifically 28 out of 80 studies, does not specify 
the AI technologies used, as they addressed AI in general instead (Fan & 
Zhong, 2022; Zhou & Li, 2021). This lack of specificity is probably due to 
educational AI being still explored as a notion and as a subject of edu-
cation, as evident in the results, although it limits understanding of the 
precise technologies applied and their distinct impacts, which widens 
the gap in research between theory and practice. To add, while there is 
some discussion on ethical considerations and cultural responsiveness, 
comprehensive studies on the long-term effects of AI, its impact on 
privacy, and detailed frameworks for curriculum integration are notably 
absent (Kerneˇza, 2023; Luo et al., 2023). Moreover, many AI prototypes 
exhibit inconsistent accuracy, a tendency to overfit narrow datasets, and 
opaque decision-making processes that are rarely transparent to end 
users. These issues can undermine teacher trust and hinder scalability 
unless proactively addressed through rigorous user-centered design and 
robust validation in authentic classroom contexts.
5.2. AI curriculum design and future directions
Designing robust curricula is a critical educational investment, with 
growing interest in the integration of AI technologies to enhance cur-
riculum design, teaching, and assessment in elementary education. 
Research emphasizes the importance of incorporating AI literacy 
through culturally responsive, hands-on models like the “AI for Kids” 
curriculum (Yang, 2022) and AI-enhanced technologies (Zhou & Li, 
2021). While these initiatives aim to boost digital literacy and early AI 
engagement, their long-term value and effectiveness still need to be 
thoroughly investigated. Teaching fundamental skills like reading and 
numeracy early on is well-supported by research as yielding high returns 
throughout a student’s academic life, but the necessity of AI literacy in 
elementary education still requires academic scrutiny, as its role in ac-
ademic achievement has not yet been clearly established, especially 
compared to its more advanced applications in higher education (Su & 
Zhong, 2022; Zhou & Li, 2021). To avoid a superficial adoption of AI 
driven by trends, it is crucial to conduct longitudinal studies to assess the 
long-term impacts and develop frameworks ensuring continuity in 
higher education. This includes creating adaptive, inclusive AI curricula 
that address diverse learner needs and ethical considerations, investing 
in professional development, designing age-appropriate AI tools that 
support foundational skills, and ensuring equitable access to AI re-
sources. Nevertheless, uptake often stalls when educators encounter 
steep learning curves, philosophical objections to automation, or 
perceive AI as a threat to their professional judgment. Future training 
programs 
must 
therefore 
pair 
technical 
upskilling 
with 
change-management strategies, peer mentoring, hands-on coaching, 
and co-design to foster meaningful teacher ownership as part of stake-
holders’ enablement and engagement.
5.3. STEM education, stakeholder engagement, and personalized learning
Consistent with previous studies (Guo et al., 2024; Humble & 
Mozelius, 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022) that explored AI in secondary 
education, elementary curricula that implement STEM programs also 
seem to be interested in leveraging the potential of AI. Although these 
programs show promise in enhancing students’ expression skills, ques-
tioning, geometric thinking, and metacognitive task performance 
through AI-driven tools like Xiao Ling and Alcody, the findings remain 
limited to specific subjects and skills. There is still a need for robust 
evaluation frameworks to assess STEM education in light of AI use, 
alongside personalized learning support through cognitive knowledge 
representation models and curriculum development (Jang et al., 2022; 
Li et al., 2023; Morales-Urrutia et al., 2020). While curriculum devel-
opment, teaching, and learning are the most discussed themes in the 
analyzed studies, exploring key stakeholders’ perspectives regarding AI 
integration stands out as a key topic of discussion. This is indicative of 
the nascent nature of the topic as researchers gather information about 
practitioners’, for instance, opinions, concerns, and insights. Insights 
from the field are crucial for outlining policies and guidelines upon 
which AI tools should be designed to support the process of teaching and 
learning. Besides, investing in professional development that hinges on 
improving learning outcomes for educators, designing age-appropriate 
AI learning tools that reinforce fundamental literacy and numeracy 
skills, and ensuring equitable access to AI resources are crucial steps 
toward supporting elementary education and effectively preparing stu-
dents for an AI-driven future. Although this sounds promising, it must be 
admitted that many schools, particularly in developing countries and 
underfunded districts, lack the necessary hardware, reliable internet, or 
ongoing maintenance budgets to adopt AI at scale. Addressing this re-
quires low-cost, offline-capable solutions, public–private partnerships 
for 
subsidized 
deployments 
are 
necessary, 
and 
clear 
total-cost-of-ownership analyses to guide district-level decision-making.
5.4. AI literacy, developmental needs, and differentiated impacts
Speaking of the future, nuances in the data suggest AI literacy for 
students and teachers may be a proactive step in anticipating the need 
for AI literacy skills to become fundamental soon, especially since many 
educational AI applications have been explored for impact on the 
improvement of teaching and learning. The analyzed data highlight the 
impact of AI applications on teaching and learning, underscoring several 
key themes: the efficacy of AI agents, ITS, social agents, and conversa-
tional robots in personalized learning, as well as the role of AI in core 
subject areas like language and mathematics (Fridin, 2014; Neumann, 
T. Boulhrir and M. Hamash

2019; Shih et al., 2023). Moreover, AI’s application in personalized 
learning demonstrates its potential to adapt educational content and 
streamline tasks (Alobaidi et al., 2015; Gadanidis, 2017; Jauhiainen & 
Guerra, 2023; Johler & Krumsvik, 2022; Zhang & Liu, 2024) which 
aligns with findings from higher levels of education (Bond et al., 2024; 
Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019). However, it is worth noting that 
elementary education uniquely benefits from interactive AI tools 
designed to foster early cognitive and language skills, while secondary 
and higher education often focus on advanced applications and broader 
content areas (Jeon, 2023; Liu & Lu, 2023; So & Lee, 2023). It is also 
worth mentioning that these benefits also carry pressing ethical con-
cerns that academic community needs to discuss to align educational 
goals with ethical considerations.
5.5. Pedagogical and theoretical implications
The findings of this review highlight several important pedagogical 
and theoretical implications that intersect with established educational 
theories such as constructivism, sociocultural theory, and the principle 
of scaffolding. At their core, many AI applications identified in the 
analyzed studies align with constructivist approaches to learning, 
wherein students actively construct knowledge through interaction with 
their environment (Piaget, 1952). AI-powered tools such as intelligent 
tutoring systems, conversational agents, and gamified platforms can 
offer interactive, exploratory environments that allow students to 
experiment, receive feedback, and make meaning, central tenets of a 
constructivist learning experience.
Revising the theoretical foundations discussed in the introduction, 
the role of AI in supporting scaffolded learning (Wood, Bruner, & Ross, 
1976) is particularly salient in elementary education. Several studies 
emphasize the use of AI to provide just-in-time support, adaptive feed-
back, and personalized pathways, mirroring the educational function of 
scaffolding traditionally provided by teachers. For instance, AI systems 
that adjust task difficulty based on student responses embody the prin-
ciple of contingent support, gradually transferring responsibility to the 
learner as competence develops. This suggests that when designed 
ethically and developmentally appropriately, AI can extend and com-
plement teachers’ scaffolding, particularly in classrooms with diverse 
learning needs by providing learning opportunities within Vygotsky’s 
zone of approximal development.
The review’s findings also align with Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory 
(1978), which views learning as fundamentally social and mediated by 
cultural tools. AI systems, particularly social agents and collaborative 
platforms, can function as mediational tools within a learner’s ZPD, 
providing dynamic, interactive support that bridges the gap between 
what a child can do independently and what they can achieve with 
guidance. However, these affordances depend on thoughtful integration 
that considers cultural responsiveness, learner agency, and teacher 
facilitation. More importantly, the findings raise critical questions 
regarding developmentally appropriate practice (DAP) in AI integration. 
While some AI applications demonstrate promise in supporting language 
development, numeracy, and metacognition, others risk cognitive 
overload or displacing essential hands-on, relational, and play-based 
learning central to early education (Copple & Bredekamp, 2009). This 
underscores the need for pedagogical frameworks that balance innova-
tion with child development principles, ensuring that AI tools supple-
ment rather than supplant core learning experiences. These insights also 
stress the pressing need for pedagogical frameworks that harmonize 
technological innovation with child development principles, laying the 
groundwork for ethical considerations in the use of AI in elementary 
education.
5.6. Ethical considerations in AI-enhanced elementary education
A growing area of concern in AI-enhanced education involves the 
potential for academic dishonesty and the ethical use of generative AI 
tools, especially LLMs. Although AI has proven effective in assisting 
teachers in catering to the zones of approximal development and scaf-
folding personalized learning, there is a risk of overreliance wherein 
students use AI-generated answers without engaging in the cognitive 
processes necessary for deep learning (Luckin et al., 2016). In elemen-
tary contexts, this raises critical questions about developmental appro-
priateness: when does support become substitution and where do we 
draw the line? Even though one might argue that elementary school 
children lack the motivation to cheat, there is insufficient empirical 
evidence to confirm or refute this claim. In fact, probing the effective-
ness of computer-based literacy programs in fostering intrinsic motiva-
tion for reading has yielded inconclusive results (Boulhrir, 2017). The 
increasing use of technology in early education, particularly in reading 
and writing, raises ethical questions that demand further exploration. 
For instance, AI tools used for writing assistance, such as summarizing or 
drafting text, may blur the line between legitimate learning support and 
plagiarism. Compounding this issue is the fact that some LLMs may 
inadvertently reproduce copyrighted or plagiarized content, potentially 
misleading young learners into assuming AI-generated outputs are 
wholly original (Zellers et al., 2019). Educators and designers of AI 
systems must consider embedding academic integrity features, 
AI-detection tools, and age-appropriate AI literacy into the curriculum 
to mitigate these risks while promoting responsible use. Educating and 
nurturing children in ethical responsibility is paramount in promoting 
the responsible use of AI, serving as a crucial safeguard against cheating 
and plagiarism. This is especially important given that AI detectors often 
struggle to identify content altered by paraphrasing tools and ’human-
izers’ technologies that employ AI algorithms to obscure indicators of 
AI-generated content.
Beyond academic integrity, the ethical deployment of AI in 
elementary education must address issues of data privacy and algo-
rithmic bias. AI systems often collect vast amounts of sensitive data, 
voice recordings, facial expressions, learning patterns, which can be 
particularly intrusive when applied to young children (Crawford & 
Paglen, 2021). Without clear regulatory frameworks or culturally 
responsive data practices, such systems risk exacerbating existing in-
equities. In addition, bias in AI algorithms, stemming from training data 
that underrepresents certain populations, may reproduce discriminatory 
patterns in feedback, assessment, or behavior prediction. Here, concerns 
about teacher displacement persist, particularly as adaptive AI systems 
take on instructional and evaluative roles. Rather than viewing this shift 
as automation-led obsolescence, future work should explore how AI 
might augment rather than replace the human role, freeing teachers for 
relational, contextual, and ethical dimensions of pedagogy. For instance, 
recent pilots of AI-powered writing assistants in elementary schools 
have raised alarms about students bypassing the writing process 
entirely, prompting school leaders to revise assignment design and 
assessment rubrics. These insights highlight the importance of tailoring 
AI tools to developmental stages and subject-specific needs, which is 
why further research is needed in this regard.
6. Future research recommendations
This review does not generate new empirical data but provides a 
foundational synthesis to inform future primary research. Future studies 
could empirically investigate how AI tools are implemented in real- 
world elementary classrooms, or explore stakeholder perspectives (e. 
g., students, teachers, and school leaders) through qualitative or mixed- 
method approaches. Future research should expand AI applications in 
elementary education to cover identified gaps, particularly in evaluating 
long-term impacts and ethical use. Policymakers and educators should 
collaborate with researchers to develop AI-integrated curricula that 
address diverse learning needs and ethical considerations. Enhanced 
professional development programs are also needed to help educators 
effectively incorporate AI into teaching practices but ensuring that these 
technological 
advancements 
lead 
to 
meaningful 
educational 
T. Boulhrir and M. Hamash

improvements should be the “holy grail” of educational AI research. 
Hence, there is a pressing need for studies to clarify the specific AI 
technologies and their impact on specific areas of education, particularly 
regarding ethical considerations, privacy issues, and long-term effects 
(Kerneˇza, 2023; Luo et al., 2023). Developing culturally adaptive AI 
curricula and teaching practice frameworks is essential to ensure 
responsible integration into diverse educational settings. This will 
bridge the gap between theory and practice and enhance the ethical 
application of AI technologies in education.
Researchers interested in educational AI should investigate the lon-
gitudinal impacts of AI applications on literacy and linguistic develop-
ment and conduct more experimental research on competency 
development in different contexts worldwide. A focus on skill develop-
ment with AI support will pave the way for the development of AI- 
integrated curricula aligned with 21st-century skills and beyond. AI is 
here to stay, and proactive engineering of future education will un-
doubtedly shape the philosophy and science of pedagogy. Policies and 
legislation for transparent algorithms and ethical considerations like 
data privacy are strongly urged as prerequisites for any educational 
aspect that requires the use of learners’ data. Hence, comprehensive 
strategies for effective AI implementation are necessary to meet the 
evolving needs of educators and learners, as many researchers have 
noted (Hwang et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022; Sperling et al., 2022; Su & 
Zhong, 2022).
Future research in this area should aim to address several key gaps. 
First, there is a critical need for primary empirical studies, both quali-
tative and quantitative, that explore the practical applications and 
impact of AI tools in real-world elementary classroom settings. Longi-
tudinal research is particularly important to examine the long-term ef-
fects of AI interventions on learning outcomes, student motivation, 
teacher practices, and ethical considerations. Second, future studies 
should aim for greater geographical and cultural diversity, as much of 
the existing research has been concentrated in a few regions. Including 
perspectives from underrepresented areas such as Africa, Latin America, 
and Southeast Asia will be essential for understanding how AI can be 
tailored to different cultural and educational contexts. Interdisciplinary 
collaboration will also be crucial, as insights from fields such as com-
puter science, cognitive psychology, ethics, and educational theory are 
needed to design AI solutions that are developmentally appropriate and 
context sensitive. Finally, future research should focus on co-designing 
AI tools with teachers and learners to ensure that these tools are equi-
table, transparent, accessible, and aligned with the diverse needs of 
young learners. Addressing these research gaps paves the way for re-
searchers and practitioners in the field to foster a deeper and more in-
clusive understanding of how AI can support teaching and learning in 
elementary education.
7. Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis of existing research investigates and 
spotlights the significant yet growing and promising potential of AI in 
elementary education, despite emerging ethical issues that require 
further research and discussion. As indicated in previous studies, AI’s 
integration into higher education garners substantial attention, but its 
application in early education is demonstrably more nuanced, requiring 
carefully designed and pedagogically tailored tools and approaches. The 
findings highlight the emergence of key themes in AI-driven elementary 
education, including the promising impact of AI on personalized 
learning experiences and its role in supporting core subject mastery. 
However, this analysis also reveals critical areas requiring further 
exploration. For instance, there is a noticeable lack of geographical di-
versity in the existing research which limits our understanding of how 
cultural contexts might influence the implementation and effectiveness 
of AI in elementary classrooms globally.
It is important to acknowledge the limitations of this review, how-
ever. As a secondary analysis, it synthesizes insights exclusively from 
existing peer-reviewed literature published in English and does not 
incorporate primary empirical data. This language focus may have 
inadvertently excluded relevant research published in other languages 
or disseminated through grey literature, such as conference proceedings, 
policy documents, or practitioner reflections. The temporal scope, 
restricted to the past decade, may omit foundational works that have 
shaped the discourse, as well as more recent developments beyond the 
search cut-off, which suggests that future reviews should adopt broader 
linguistic, temporal, and methodological inclusivity and remain 
responsive to the rapidly evolving nature of AI in education.
Building on these insights, future research should prioritize a more 
globally inclusive perspective, especially focusing on underrepresented 
regions such as the Global South, where educational and technological 
infrastructures differ markedly. There is also a pressing need for diverse 
methodological approaches, including longitudinal studies that assess 
sustained impact, mixed-methods designs that integrate quantitative 
outcomes with qualitative insights, and participatory research involving 
educators and learners in the design process. Interdisciplinary collabo-
ration will be critical, bringing together expertise from education, 
computer science, child psychology, and ethics to ensure that AI appli-
cations in elementary education are developmentally appropriate, 
culturally responsive, and ethically sound. Such efforts will be instru-
mental in shaping a more equitable and context-sensitive integration of 
AI into early learning environments.
