Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) has gained notable attention in educational literature, with supporters 
and critics expressing varying opinions. Despite its popularity, only a few reviews are available on the subject, 
with limitations such as small sample sizes and limited scope. This study aims to clarify the major themes 
influencing the discussion on Gen AI in educational contexts. It employs a strong Business Intelligence paradigm 
and uses bibliometric analysis and topic modeling focusing on the R program’s structural topic model (STM) 
Package, VOSviewer, and bibliometric software. The results highlight the esteem of Gen AI in education and 
evidence of international collaboration in the research process dedicated to enhancing the rapidly evolving field 
of Gen AI. The scientometric indexes indicate that the diversity of journals has the significant impact on Gen AI in 
education. While Lotka’s Law suggests that the field is still in its early stages, the collaborative network dem-
onstrates strong connections among researchers, a positive indicator of future progress. Moreover, the STM 
method has identified nine pivotal topics grouped into three categories relating to Gen AI in education. By 
shedding light on these emerging themes, this study provides educators and researchers with valuable insights 
into the future of Gen AI in education.
1. Introduction
Recently, Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tools like Gemini 
and Chat GPT have made their mark in educational technology. These 
tools generate text responses based on user-generated prompts, similar 
to chatbots (Fecher et al., 2023; Ilieva et al., 2023; Magatef et al., 2024; 
Younis & Al-Okaily, 2024). However, their use in the educational 
community has ignited discussions about their impact on education. 
While some experts believe that Gen AI can enhance the learning expe-
rience, others are concerned about its potential drawbacks. Neverthe-
less, these tools can transform how we teach and learn in the classroom 
(Abdullatif & Alrashdan, 2023; Chan, 2023; Ellis & Slade, 2023).
The potential of Gen AI knows no bounds, especially in the domain of 
education. Gen AI can generate an extensive range of content to facilitate 
teaching and learning by utilizing its natural language input and output 
abilities (Aldreabi et al., 2025; Hsu & Ching, 2023). Gen AI, such as 
Chat GPT, can assist teachers and students in numerous ways, including 
personalized learning (Chan & Lee, 2023), creative thinking (Lee et al., 
2023), assessment (Al-Gasaymeh et al., 2023; G. Currie et al., 2023), and 
improving reading and writing comprehension (Hsu & Ching, 2023). 
Gen AI can be an essential resource that assists with educational tasks, 
such as learning and assessment, providing valuable aid to both teachers 
and pupils (Podlasov & Matviichuk, 2023). By integrating appropriate 
Gen AI algorithms and Application Programming Interface (API) into 
learning apps, teachers can cater to every student’s needs without 
wasting their valuable time (Ruiz-Rojas et al., 2023).
Though Gen AI has great potential to transform educational practice, 
there are some significant issues that must be resolved. One of them is 
related to the validity of the content generated by Gen AI, which is also a 
function of the quality of training data sets (Al-Shamali et al., 2022; 
Alrabea et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023; Dwivedi et al., 2023). Containing 
outdated and/or erroneous information may be an impediment to its

utility as an instructional tool (Albdrani & Al-Shargabi, 2023; Al Dreabi 
et al., 2024; Alkharafi et al., 2024; Alqallaf et al., 2025; Kuscu et al., 
2023). Furthermore, its utilization raises valid data privacy concerns 
(Karabacak & Margetis, 2023; Wach et al., 2023) and ethical concerns 
due to biased data sources (Farrelly & Baker, 2023; Oddone et al., 2023).
In light of these important challenges, Gen AI has become a focal 
point of discussion in education and has stimulated academic interest. 
However, while it is an important topic of discussion, there remains a 
lack of large-scale review studies of the diverse and deep dimensions of 
Gen AI in education. To date, reviews that exist (e.g., Bahroun et al. 
(2023), Kalota (2024), Preiksaitis and Rose (2023) and Shoja et al. 
(2023) tend to remain focused on narrow subfields or underlying the-
ories. The studies have had an impact on scholarly work. However, they 
rely upon a small selection of research (e.g., 42 articles), which may 
limit generalizability by dimensional scope and method. Additionally, 
restricting reliance only upon content or systematic reviews may mini-
mize opportunities for identifying larger interdisciplinary trends 
(Al-Sharhan et al., 2024; Alkandari et al., 2023).
A further limitation of the literature to date is fragmentation within 
educational subfields. For instance, Farrelly and Baker (2023) address 
Gen AI in higher education, Preiksaitis and Rose (2023) in medical ed-
ucation, and Ellis and Slade (2023) in statistics and data science. These 
relevant studies, yet their context-dependent nature, speaks to the 
challenge of distilling overall trends. Even though the use of Gen AI is 
context-specific (e.g., different disciplines within chemistry, computer 
science, and the social sciences), it is still useful to highlight general 
themes, such as ethical issues (Al-Dashti et al., 2022; Alduosari et al., 
2025; Al Hussainan et al., 2022; Alkandari et al., 2024; Williams, 2024), 
student agency (Cullen & Oppenheimer, 2024), and connectedness 
(Cullen & Oppenheimer, 2024). A broad review is essential to capture 
general themes and discipline-specific patterns.
Moreover, among the possible drawbacks of applying Gen AI in 
educational settings is the threat of over-dependence that could suppress 
the acquisition of vital cognitive and scholarly skills in students, 
including writing, critical thinking, and independent learning (Wirzal 
et al., 2024). This calls for the necessity of investigating not only the 
technological feasibility but also the educational implications. Against 
these factors, the present study adopts a more integrated approach that 
combines bibliometric analysis with thematic evaluation. Rather than 
claiming to provide an exhaustive overview, this review attempts to 
provide a broader picture that connects disparate findings emphasizes 
interdisciplinary observations and enables ongoing research and policy 
debate. As such, it lays the groundwork for more advanced, longitudinal 
studies and evidence-based decisions on using Gen AI in education.
This study integrates both bibliometric analysis and topic modeling 
to systematically showcase the existing research on Gen AI in education 
and anchor it within the literature in a cohesive manner. This study’s use 
of the Structural Topic Modeling (STM) method within R (R studio STM 
Package) allows for improved accuracy of topics over standard Latent 
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in that the STM can contain various cova-
riates as well as provide analysis into the correlation of topics and 
provide a more sophisticated method of separating topics in the same 
literature domain (Chen et al., 2022). This study analyzed the last four 
years of the peer-reviewed Gen AI literature, encompassing 211 articles 
that applied to using Gen AI in some educational settings. This study has 
three research questions: 
1. What are the major research topics that Gen AI has covered in edu-
cation research?
2. In what ways do metadata like Web of Science (Wo S) and citations 
impact the main topics of Gen AI in educational research?
3. Which countries are contributing significantly to the literature on 
Gen AI in education, and what future research directions are being 
proposed?
The remainder of the current review is organized as follows: Part two 
outlines a comprehensive literature review. The third part details the 
methodology employed in the study, while the fourth part presents the 
results of bibliometric and topic modeling analyses. Subsequently, the 
fifth and sixth parts delve into the research’s discussions, implications, 
and limitations.

2.1. Generative Artificial Intelligence
The Fourth Industrial Revolution has witnessed incredible techno-
logical advancements driven by artificial intelligence (AI). One of the 
latest breakthroughs is Gen AI, which has gained significant attention for 
its capability to generate new content, such as text, images, or music, 
using trained parameters (Al-Okaily, 2025a; Kalota, 2024; Mannuru 
et al., 2023). These parameters are stored as numerical values tuned 
during training, resulting in interactions between artificial neurons that 
mimic the human brain (Alghamdi, 2024; Alhadidi et al., 2025; Alazemi 
et al., 2025; Boscardin et al., 2024).
Chat GPT is a prime example of a Gen AI model that has been trained 
across various online resources to respond to user prompts in various 
styles, including academic papers and even poems or programming 
codes (Mohammed et al., 2024). Over the next decade, Chat GPT, 
alongside other large language models like Gemini (Google) and Claude 
(Anthropic), is expected to contribute to a significant increase of $7 
trillion in global GDP and elevate productivity growth by 1.5 %. Gen AI 
can potentially transform various sectors, including education, medi-
cine, and technology (Ooi et al., 2023).
Gen AI models can also offer personalized recommendations, auto-
mate customer service, and aid writers in content creation. Chat GPT and 
its counterparts comprehend context, producing coherent, context- 
aware responses and making them viable in various fields (Al-Okaily 
& Al-Okaily, 2025; Alhawamdeh et al., 2023; Qasim et al., 2025). With 
its potential to revolutionize how we approach tasks, Gen AI holds 
immense promise for industries looking to stay ahead of the curve (Rane, 
2023).
In contrast, Gen AI models come with a set of limitations that demand 
attention as per Feuerriegel et al. (2024). One of the critical limitations 
is that these models often produce outputs with errors. The model 
generates the probable response rather than the right one, leading to 
nonsensical content. Additionally, these outputs are challenging to 
verify, making it difficult to trust them completely (Al-Okaily, 2025b; 
Alazmi & Rakha, 2022).
Another significant limitation of Gen AI models is their potential to 
replicate and amplify biases from their training data unintentionally 
(Almarri & Elayah, 2024; Hjij, 2023; Alhawamdeh et al., 2023; Alahmed 
et al., 2023; El-Sayed, 2023; Aldaaja et al., 2025). This can perpetuate 
gender, racial, or religious stereotypes, among other biases. Addressing 
these biases and ensuring fairness in AI is crucial, and researchers are 
actively working to overcome this challenge (Al-Okaily et al., 2024; 
Al-Omoush et al., 2022).
Gen AI also poses a risk of infringing on copyrighted works, 
depending on what the model was trained on. Furthermore, there are 
legal questions surrounding the intellectual property of AI-generated 
content (Alazmi & Al-Anzi, 2023; Qatawneh et al., 2025; Shantha-
lakshmi et al., 2024).
Lastly, developing and using large Gen AI models often comes with a 
significant carbon footprint due to their computational requirements. As 
we strive to make AI development and deployment more energy- 
efficient, it is vital to consider the environmental impact of these 
models. Overall, understanding these limitations is crucial when work-
ing with Gen AI models.
2.2. Generative AI in education
Advancements in Gen AI, like Chat GPT, have significantly impacted 
H. Aldreabi et al.

various domains, including education (Almasre, 2024). As a result, ed-
ucation experts have raised questions about how to leverage this tech-
nology and mitigate its potential threats effectively (Alshemmari, 2024; 
Betar & Murtaza, 2023; Elgedawy, 2024; Podlasov & Matviichuk, 2023). 
While some educators have been cautious about Chat GPT, taking steps 
to limit its use in academic settings, others have expressed concerns that 
students may use it to cheat or generate work that is not their own, 
thereby threatening academic integrity. Educators are implementing 
various measures to address these concerns, like using tools to detect 
Chat GPT usage or introducing alternative assessment approaches (Ellis 
& Slade, 2023).
Sun and Hoelscher (2023) also highlight a crucial consideration to 
keep in mind regarding Gen AI in education, which is the potential risk of 
students becoming overly reliant on it. This could impede their critical 
thinking, problem-solving, and independent learning skills. As an 
AI-powered tool, Gen AI also raises broader ethical concerns, such as 
plagiarism and privacy, as well as the potential for biases and the pro-
duction of inaccurate information (Fu, 2024).
Conversely, numerous studies highlight the diverse potential of 
Gen AI as a transformative tool in education, with applications that vary 
across different fields of expertise (Alazmi, 2023; Alazmi & Alemtairy, 
2024; Alkhaldi et al., 2024; Ximenes et al., 2025). Gen AI helps higher 
education students with scholarly writing and offers research support 
while developing educational content (Fecher et al., 2023; Ilieva et al., 
2023; Perkins et al., 2023). The statistics and data science field benefits 
from Gen AI because it enables the clarification of intricate topics while 
performing automated analysis of data records (Ellis & Slade, 2023). 
Implementing Gen AI in school education provides automatic feedback 
and adaptive testing capabilities, improving assessment practices 
(Jauhiainen & Guerra, 2023). The medical field incorporation of Gen AI 
supports patients in clinical simulations along with diagnostic training 
and personalized learning modules (Indran et al., 2023; Wong et al., 
2023). Gen AI helps Learning Analytics analyze data in real-time while 
customizing students’ learning pathways through its application (Chang 
et al., 2023; Khosravi et al., 2023).
By using Gen AI, there is an opportunity to tailor the learning expe-
rience to suit the unique preferences and requirements of teachers and 
students. Among the suite of tools available, Chat GPT holds immense 
promise, for instance, in China, with its potential for applications 
ranging from lesson planning and student-centered learning to in-class 
interactions and assignment evaluations. Gen AI is being used to create 
a dynamic and engaging learning environment (Al-Okaily, 2024; Yang 
et al., 2023). In training educators, the Gen AI tool “GPTeach” by Markel 
et al. (2023) is a significant step towards providing novice teachers with 
a safe and interactive training platform. By simulating student in-
teractions, teachers can iterate their responses in real-time and across 
multiple sessions, thereby enhancing their teaching skills.
Additionally, the educational toolkit consists of Khanmigo, which 
provides AI tutor services to students during live instruction while 
increasing teaching efficiency (Yılmaz et al., 2025), and Socratic from 
Google, which assists students in grasping subject material through 
interactive questions and answers (Chin, 2007; Getachew, 2024). The 
various applications highlighted— from personalized learning and 
teacher coaching to individual student tutoring—indicate that Gen AI 
could greatly transform education. So, to take advantage of these ad-
vances in a balanced way and prevent the possible risks, we have to look 
deeply at Gen AI. So, much research should be carried out on Gen AI to 
explore both what it can do and its boundary lines, as well as ethics 
related to using it broadly in education.
3. Methodology
The STM based bibliometric methodology is a unique approach that 
distinguishes itself from systematic analysis methodologies used in ed-
ucation field research (Chen et al., 2024). This technique utilizes un-
supervised machine modeling algorithms on large-scale literature data 
to identify unpredictable and diverse topics that are important to re-
searchers in the field of education (Alhur et al., 2022). Unlike other 
methodologies that rely on predefined dimensions and categories, the 
STM approach explores issues related to education techniques, appli-
cations, and pedagogical concerns. This popular approach in educa-
tional technology is highly effective in capturing historical and current 
research progress, technology development, and emerging ideas. By 
analyzing a vast amount of literature data, the STM-based bibliometric 
methodology provides researchers with valuable insights into the latest 
educational trends and developments (Chen et al., 2022). These tools are 
practical in the field of educational data analytics, providing 
evidence-based information on the direction of pedagogical status and 
informing instructional and policy choices.
When examining topic modeling techniques, a notable distinction 
arises between STM and LDA (Tamakloe & Park, 2023). STM stands out 
by integrating document-level metadata, which enables researchers to 
explore how various attributes affect the prevalence and content of 
topics (Roberts et al., 2019). In comparison, LDA focuses solely on the 
text within documents, neglecting any external context, which can limit 
its interpretative capabilities (Roberts et al., 2016).
Furthermore, LDA requires researchers to define the number of 
topics in advance, a process that might oversimplify complex datasets 
(Alzboun et al., 2023; Gillings & Hardie, 2023). In contrast, STM pro-
vides greater adaptability by allowing topics to emerge organically from 
the textual data and its associated metadata (Schulze et al., 2024). This 
flexibility enhances the effectiveness of STM, particularly when 
analyzing short documents often prevalent in educational research. Ul-
timately, this approach fosters a more comprehensive understanding of 
inter-topic relationships, leading to deeper insights into the evolving 
trends and challenges present within the field (Murshed et al., 2023).
In the initial stage, we investigated documents related to the inte-
gration of Gen AI in Education. We searched the Wo S with particular 
keywords, “education and Gen AI”, “Chat GPT”, “Google Bard”, “Gener-
ative AI”, “Education and Generative AI”, and “Generative Artificial 
Intelligence in education”, and identified 839 documents, including 
articles, proceeding papers, editorial materials, and letters.
In the subsequent stage, we meticulously assessed each article, 
adhering to the inclusion criteria and preprocessing procedures. As a 
result, we identified 211 articles that fully met all the requirements and 
were deemed suitable for further examination. A bibliometric analysis of 
the selected articles followed the process of shortlisting articles.
Using the bibliometric R package, the study analyzed trends based on 
year, country, and journal and evaluated collaboration between authors 
and countries. Additionally, metadata was analyzed with the STM 
package to identify nine emerging research themes in the field of Gen AI 
in education. The following sub-sections illustrate how the data was 
gathered, prepared, and analyzed.
3.1. Data collection
Determining the origins of Gen AI in education is challenging due to 
its continuous evolution. However, interest in this transformative field 
has surged, particularly since 2021. To delve into this topic, we selected 
influential journal articles from esteemed databases, including the Arts 
& Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI), Emerging Sources Citation Index 
(ESCI), Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), and Social 
Science Citation Index (SSCI), all recognized for their impactful research 
on Gen AI in educational contexts.
On June 30, 2024, we undertook a systematic data collection to 
obtain valuable data on Gen AI in education. The search identified arti-
cles using keywords in the title and keywords and abstracts fields, “ed-
ucation and Gen AI”, “Chat GPT”, “Google Bard”, “Generative AI”, 
“Education and Generative AI”, and “Generative Artificial Intelligence in 
education”. Our systematic search was completed using the premier 
Wo S database. The Wo S database is well-respected and is a repository of 
peer-reviewed literature across disciplines.
H. Aldreabi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Computers and Education: Artiϧcial Intelligence 9 (2025) 100456 

--- Page 4 ---

Initially, we identified 839 articles; however, after careful review, we 
found that 392 were unrelated to education. We applied specific 
exclusion criteria, such as the absence of abstracts (121), non-essential 
article formats like letters and reviews (109), and non-English publica-
tions (6), to refine our selection. This meticulous process ensured that 
only the most relevant articles were included in our study. In the end, we 
deemed 211 articles to be pertinent. We then meticulously extracted 
bibliographic information from each selected article, including titles, 
abstracts, document types, keywords, language, Wo S categories, science 
index, open access designations, research areas, publication years, and 
author affiliations, using tailored scraping scripts as suggested by pre-
vious works (Qasim et al., 2023). This comprehensive information was 
organized and preserved in an Excel file for future analysis, setting the 
stage for a detailed exploration of Gen AI’s impact on education.
3.2. Data preprocessing
In the preprocessing stage, several steps were taken. Initially, articles 
that were duplicated, not in English, unrelated to education, lacking 
abstracts, or not research papers were excluded. In the preprocessing 
stage, many steps were taken; initially, replicated articles, non-English 
language, non-education articles, articles without abstracts, and no 
research papers were deleted (see Fig. 1).
Subsequently, the data is processed by the “text Processor” function 
within the STM package. This processing involves several tasks, 
including making all the text lowercase, eliminating punctuation marks, 
removing stopwords, numbers, and stemming. The process resulted in 
the removal of 2092 out of 2767 terms (3785 out of 17511 tokens) due 
to frequency. The final corpus now contains 211 documents, 675 terms, 
and 13726 tokens, as shown in (Fig. 2).
4. Data analysis
The data analysis stage consists of two steps: STM package (Roberts 
et al., 2019), and Bibliometric package (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017).
4.1. Structural Topic Modeling
The STM package represents a cutting-edge extension of probabilistic 
topic models, drawing upon the LDA model, correlated topic model 
(CTM), and other related models. Utilizing a highly efficient and semi- 
automated machine-learning approach, it is designed to uncover hid-
den themes within a collection of documents (Chen & Xie, 2020). As 
with other topic models, the STM generates word counts within a 
defined data-generating process for each document, ultimately identi-
fying the likely parameters within the model (Alzboun et al., 2024; 
Roberts et al., 2019).
When conducting STM analysis, several steps are required to

H. Aldreabi et al.

evaluate STM before arriving at a final assessment. One such step is 
identifying the optimal number of topics (k) that accurately represents 
the themes present within the text corpus. While various approaches 
exist, none are inherently superior to others (Al kharafi, 2025; Pirri 
et al., 2020). In this study, the procedure outlined by Weston et al. 
(2023) was followed to determine the ideal number of topics. This 
involved analyzing the fit statistics of several potential solutions, nar-
rowing them down to a manageable number of models, and ultimately 
selecting a few of these models for further evaluation.
As suggested by Weston et al. (2023), To maximize the identification 
of potential topics, researchers should take into account the quantity and 
length of responses, as well as the level of specificity in the prompt. 
Generally, a greater number of longer responses provide more oppor-
tunities for topic identification, while a narrow focus on the questions 
limits such possibilities. For our research, we had a significant amount of 
data in the form of article abstracts. Still, with a specific prompt at hand, 
we anticipated a smaller number of dominant themes. Hence, we 
extracted up to 18 solutions for all possible topics, starting from a 
minimum of three.
The search K function, part of the STM package, can estimate 18 
solutions efficiently. It can also extract fit statistics for comparison based 
on four basic metrics (refer to Figs. 2 and 3). These metrics are exclu-
sivity, which measures the uniqueness of words to a specific topic; se-
mantic coherence, which is used to determine how frequently the 
probable words in a topic appear together (Chen et al., 2022); residuals, 
which estimate the dispersion of residuals for a solution; and the vari-
ational lower bound, which is used to determine the convergence of a 
particular solution. Some experts recommend searching for local 
minima to identify the best solution (Al Dreabi et al., 2024; Weston et al., 
2023).
The residual and variational lower bound diagnostic fit indexes were 
insufficient to determine the optimum number of topics. However, Fig. 4
provides a better understanding of the matter. The plot in Fig. 4 repre-
sents semantic coherence and exclusivity on its axes, with the mean 
exclusivity and semantic coherence values of the 18 candidate models 
shown as blue and red lines. The 9-topics model located in the upper- 
right corner of the plot displays higher semantic coherence and exclu-

In addition, qualitative assessments were conducted, with two in-
dependent authors evaluating the topic models generated across the K 
range. Both reviewers, blinded to the metric-based analysis, agreed that 
the 9-topic model most effectively represented the subject matter. This 
alignment between quantitative metrics and expert qualitative evalua-
tion indicates a model that successfully captures meaningful thematic 
structures within the corpus, enhancing interpretability and relevance to 
the domain while preserving computational feasibility (Alhaimer, 2024; 
Hassan et al., 2021; Mimno et al., 2011; Roberts et al., 2019).
Assessing the quality of machine learning outcomes can be a difficult 
task due to issues related to explainability. Nevertheless, there have 
been some suggestions in previous research on evaluating the topical 
quality of STM outcomes (Alkharafi, 2025; Alzboun et al., 2024). One of 
the approaches is to analyze the correlations between topics, which can 
reveal their semantic associations. When two topics correlate 0.7 or 
higher, it becomes problematic, as it implies that the underlying terms of 
both topics are highly similar. This inaccuracy occurs because there is a 
high probability that both correlated topics refer to the same set of 
documents. Fortunately, the topic correlation matrix depicted in Fig. 5
demonstrates that all correlation values are less than 0.7, indicating that 
the topic modeling results are promising (Kraus et al., 2023).
4.2. Bibliometric analysis
Our study utilizes bibliometric analysis to determine the most cited 
articles and the geographical distribution of affiliated authors exploring 
using Gen AI in education. Our comprehensive analysis includes journal, 
intellectual structure, social structure, document, and co-authorship 
analyses. It is essential to highlight that bibliometric analysis is a 
dependable and unbiased approach to assessing scholarly research and 
evaluating its scientific merits through quantitative and statistical 
methods (Alhaimer, 2025; Donthu et al., 2021; Kraus et al., 2023; 
Rashed, 2023; Alkhaldi; et al., 2024). To conduct this analysis, the study 
utilized the well-established Bibliometric package and VOSviewer soft-
ware (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017).
5. Results
5.1. Bibliometric results
With the introduction of cutting-edge Gen AI tools such as Chat GPT 
and Bard, we have been exploring the impact of AI on education and 
teaching. As we continue to adapt to these rapidly advancing technol-
ogies and observe how students interact with them, an increasing 
number of researchers are delving into the effects of Gen AI tools in 
education. Fig. 6 illustrates the significant rise in research on this topic, 
increasing from an average of five articles between 2021 and 2022 to a 
staggering 97 between 2023 and the beginning of 2024.

to provide an overview of the main categories of journals that study 
Gen AI in education and the countries that source this study. The dia-
gram, shown in Fig. 7, highlights the interests of researchers in different 
countries. For instance, researchers in the USA and Australia are mainly 
interested in AI in general, followed by Gen AI (Chat GPT), assessment, 
and education in general. On the other hand, in China and India, the 
dominant research topics are Gen AI, with a particular focus on Chat GPT 
and education in general. Moreover, the keywords in European coun-
tries like the UK, Germany, Spain, and Finland are distributed across 
topics like Gen AI, higher education, and academic integrity.
Additionally, the source of articles comes from three main cate-
gories: journals related to education and educational technology, med-
ical and medical education journals, and journals related to information 
technology. These findings provide valuable insights into the current 
trends and interests of researchers studying Gen AI in education across 
different countries and disciplines.
5.1.1. Major publication sources, countries, authorships, and affiliations
In our analysis of Gen AI in education literature, we employed 
Bradford’s Law, a tool used to measure primary sources and journals. 
This law is based on the principle of diminishing returns, which helps 
identify the “core” journals in a given field. By applying this law, we 
were able to determine the top 13 sources that contributed to 33.2 % of 
Gen AI in education - these sources are considered the core journals in 
this field. Interestingly, our findings showed that seven sources were in 
the education domain, while the remaining three were in the medical 
and technology domains. Fig. 8 provides a visual representation of our 
results.
On the other hand, The Scientometrics index employs citation-based 
metrics like H-index, G-index, and M-index. Unlike the journal impact 
factor, which merely ranks scientific journals based on their impact 
factor, scientometrics indexes can effectively rank scientists, scientific 
journals, and countries. This study utilizes indicators, including H-index, 
G-index, M-index, and total citations, to gauge the impact and produc-
tivity of journals. The results show in Table 1 that there are variations in 
bibliometric indicators across different fields. For instance, medical 
journals like JMIR Medical Education and Cureus Journal of Medical 
Science exhibit higher impact metrics with H-indices ranging from 3 to 
4, indicating a significant influence of Gen AI in the education domain. 
On the other hand, education journals such as Education for Chemical 
Engineers and Education Sciences demonstrate comparatively lower 
impact metrics with H-indices of 2. These variations underscore the 
diverse landscape of sources covering Gen AI in the education 
environment.
In addition, Fig. 9 provides a proper visual representation of the 
collaborative efforts of countries researching Gen AI in education. The 
map displays the contribution level, ranging from dark blue to light blue, 
with gray indicating no contribution. The edges between countries 
indicate collaboration between them, with thicker lines representing 
stronger or more frequent collaborations, and thinner lines indicating 
weaker or less frequent ones.
The strongest collaboration, which is predictable given the leading 
investment and publication volumes from the United States and China in 
Gen AI, is between authors from the two countries. The U.S. is closely 
followed by strong connectedness with Australia and many European 
countries, highlighting the widespread multinational cooperation that 
underlies Gen AI and education.
In the same line, Table 2 displays the top 10 countries that have 
produced the highest number of scholarly articles from 2021 to 2024, 
with the top 10 being presented. It also presents their collaboration 
indices, which indicate the extent of their collaboration within their own 
single country publications (SCP) and with other multiple countries 
publications (MCP). The United States leads the list with 52 articles and 
a strong emphasis on domestic collaborations (SCP index of 40) and 
significant international collaborations (MCP index of 12). Australia and 
China follow closely with 24 and 22 articles, respectively, showing a 
balanced distribution between intra-country and inter-country

collaboration. The United Kingdom, India, and Germany also contribute 
significantly to scholarly research with varying degrees of collaboration 
within their country and with other countries.
Additionally, Fig. 10 shows a visual representation of the mean 
citation counts for universities actively researching Gen AI in education. 
The circles in the image depict the universities, with each circle’s size 
reflecting the average citation count for that particular university’s 
research. The lines connecting the circles represent co-authorship re-
lationships among these universities, with each line’s thickness indi-
cating the relationship’s strength. The same figure highlights that 
several universities have been actively publishing research on Gen AI in 
education and frequently collaborating on research papers, including 
Indiana University, the University of Michigan, Charles Sturt University, 
Deakin University, MIT Institute, Jozef Pilsudski University, Shimane 
University, and Toronto University which has the highest average cita-
tion counts.
5.1.2. Author productivity
Examining scientific literature is a crucial component of biblio-
graphic measurements, which involves the analysis of bibliometric laws. 
One of these laws, Lotka’s (refer to Fig. 11), primarily focuses on author 
productivity. In 1926, Alfred J. Lotka published his groundbreaking 
study, “Frequency distribution of scientific productivity determined 
from a decade index (1907–1916) of chemical contractions.” Lotka 
concluded that “the number of authors making n contributions is about 
1/n2 of those making one, and the proportion of all contributors that 
make a single contribution is about 60 %" (Nagaiah et al., 2021). In other 
words, the pattern observed is that the distribution of authors who have 
published a certain number of articles can be predicted to follow an 
inverse square distribution (see Fig. 12).
Lotka’s law can also be applied to estimate the productivity of a 
scientific community and predict new writers. Nevertheless, this prin-
ciple is based on statistical observations and disregards individual 
research interests, talent, and opportunities. The chart below depicts the 
most suitable match for a power-law distribution, represented by a solid 
black line, and a power law with a cutoff, represented by a dotted black 
line. It was discovered that, on average, an author published two 
research papers on Gen AI in the education domain.
When examining the co-authorship relationships between re-
searchers who have published on Gen AI in education, several insights 
can be drawn from the figure below. One key observation is the 
collaborative solid network among these researchers, as evidenced by 
their numerous connections. However, the figure also suggests that the 
field is still in its early stages, as reflected by the relatively low average 
citation counts. Most authors have an average citation count of around 
ten or less because Gen AI is a relatively new field, and research on its 
application in education is even more recent.
Despite this, the collaborative nature of research in this area is 
promising. As more researchers enter the field and build upon each 
other’s work, we expect to see an increase in the average citation count 
and a more significant impact of Gen AI research on education.

5.1.2.1. Major research topics and their evolutions. The R language’s 
“STM” package includes a useful function called “Label Topics” that can 
be used to label identified topics. This function produces a collection of 
topic-related terms with four distinct weightings: Highest Probability, 
FREX, Lift, and Score, each indicating a different degree of importance. 
The study employs these weightings to identify the most suitable and 
specific labels accurately representing the topic. The ultimate selection 
of each label is validated based on its relevance, specificity, and accu-
racy, which are clarified in Appendix 1. The study employs the “find-
Thoughts” function to generate a representative text sample that aids 
researchers in selecting the most appropriate label for each topic and 
better comprehending the context of the top words in each topic, as 
shown in Fig. 13.
On the other hand, the STM has delineated nine significant themes 
concerning Gen AI in education, illustrated in a polar chart that depicts 
each category’s relative frequency in the corpora. The most dominant 
group is Research Methodology, comprising around 38.5 % of the total 
distribution. This group mainly centers around the Gen AI technology, 
which poses ethical and legal questions while presenting prospects and 
obstacles. Furthermore, it can significantly influence education 
research, both favorably and unfavorably. In contrast, topics such as 
academic writing integrity, medical education, and the potential use of 
Gen AI in education are less frequently discussed in the context of Gen AI 
used in education, with percentages ranging from 1.43 % to 2.42 %, 
respectively.

5.1.3. Topics interpretation
Based on the five top words and previous studies in Fig. 14 and 
Appendix 1, it is clear that the topics covered are related to significant 
challenges and potentials in the field of Gen AI in education. We will now 
provide some explanations of nine topics.
Topic one focuses on academic integrity in writing, which only ac-
counts for 1.4 % Of the abstract’s corpora. The most commonly used 
words in this topic are “writing,” “academic,” and “tools,” which shed 
light on the various implications and challenges that AI-powered writing 
tools present in educational environments. Although this topic is less 
dominant in the corpus, it raises critical concerns about the erosion of 
academic norms. One study reflects a conceptual shift: “Research on 
academic integrity used to focus more on student character and behavior. 
Now, this Research includes a wider viewing of this issue as a current teaching 
and learning challenge that requires pedagogical intervention.” (Escalante 
et al., 2023). Such discourse indicates that academic integrity is now 
framed as a systemic responsibility rather than just a student issue. The 
study further critiques how automated paraphrasing tools (APTs) are 
marketed: “These developments present a creeping erosion of academic 
integrity under the guise of legitimate academic assistance.” This reflects 
broader anxieties around AI-generated content, especially as it relates to 
legitimate authorship and originality. In another example, academic 
writing tasks using chatbots showed a lack of disciplinary depth, where 
“chatbots rarely incorporated the discussion of electron movement, a key 
feature of mechanistic reasoning." (Scheschenja et al., 2024). Thus, aca-
demic writing integrity in AI demands pedagogical strategies that 
cultivate critical literacy and discipline-specific reasoning rather than 
just fluency.
Topic two delves into the potential of AI in education and highlights 
essential terms such as “generative,” “intelligence,” and “potential.” The 
topic is stated from a positive perspective about the transformative po-
tential of AI, yet also acknowledging real challenges. Abstracts highlight 
the capacity of instruments such as GPT-4 and DALL-E to “initiate a 
paradigm shift in information acquisition and learning” while calling for 
“digital literacy and ethical use of AI” (Wood et al., 2023). Academic 
papers elaborate further on the potential of AI to augment creativity and 
customize learning environments (Aljawazneh & Qasim, 2024); how-
ever, they also warn of the potential that reliance upon “black box” 
calculations can decrease students’ active engagement (Wood et al., 
2023). Taken as a whole, the literature suggests that an overall grasp of 
the application of Gen AI depends largely on the readiness of students 
and teachers to employ interpretive frameworks that facilitate human 
action, ethical practices, and reflective methods.
Additionally, the abstracts covering the third topic, Medical Educa-
tion, offer an overall view of the integration of the use of Gen AI into the 
fields of clinical practice and medical education. Technologies such as 
GPT-4 and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are viewed as 
revolutionary, enabling activities such as diagnostic aid, clinical 
decision-making, and patient education. A notable study that deter-
mined the effectiveness of Chat GPT in the setting of the Chinese medical 
licensure exams concluded that “GPT-4 is equal to Chinese medical 
professionals” and performs better in tasks such as discharge summari-
zation and interactive learning (Karadag et al., 2023). However, in light 
of these developments, the same study points to the continued existence 
of issues—mainly “hallucinations, legal issues, and ethical challenges.” 
The coexistence of these observations points to the need for finding 
equilibrium in the face of development since mistakes in a high-stakes 
industry such as medicine can be costly (Alhur et al., 2024). This con-
versation points toward the need to increase AI literacy among health-
care professionals and develop strong evaluation frameworks (Eletter

et al., 2023).
The fourth topic discusses the growing focus on AI-backed game- 
based learning in educational environments. Educators increasingly use 
Gen AI tools like DALL-E and Chat GPT to enable interactive, engaging, 
and learner-centered learning experiences in classes (Lim et al., 2023). 
An abstract describes a situation in which a student cohort who learned 
game coding explored using Open AI technology during their game 
development activities. The study found that the use of AI was viewed as

“productive and popular,” enabling their ability to implement technical 
solutions while promoting high levels of reflection in their utilization 
(Javed et al., 2022). These findings suggest that AI can play a role in 
supporting experiential learning since it enables learners to explore 
concepts creatively while developing relevant technical and meta-
cognitive skills. The study reiterates that AI-supported gamified learning 
offers high potential in increasing motivation and delivering more ful-
filling, inquiry-driven learning environments.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the fifth topic related to 
adopting Gen AI in education. For instance, Strzelecki El Arabawy (2024)
researched the acceptance and utilization of Chat GPT among teachers 
and students in higher education, using theoretical frameworks of 
acceptance technology to analyze the factors that influence its adoption. 
These studies have uncovered essential determinants like perceived 
usefulness, social presence, legitimacy, enjoyment, motivation, and 
resistance factors like perceived bias and inaccuracies (Tiwari et al., 
2023). Studies also offer insights into the complex dynamics of Gen AI 
integration in education, including educators’ motivation, learners’ AI 
competency, and students’ attitudes toward Chat GPT. Additionally, 
You Tube channels dedicated to language learning with AI tools like 
Chat GPT are explored, highlighting content creators’ roles in the lan-
guage education ecosystem (Li et al., 2023).
The abstracts under the sixth topic focus on using Gen AI tools for 
assessment and performance evaluation in medical education. These 
studies assess the accuracy and reliability of Gen AI tools such as 
Chat GPT in generating patient information leaflets, providing compre-
hensive patient education, and facilitating medical education (Lockie & 
Choi, 2023; Mdanat et al., 2024). Although Gen AI models like Chat GPT 
exhibit potential, challenges such as formulating precise requests and 
addressing potential limitations must be considered for effective utili-
zation in educational settings (Jiao et al., 2023; Scheschenja et al., 
2024). These studies offer valuable insights into the evolving role of 
Gen AI in education and medical training (Bartoli et al., 2024).
The seventh topic, which is related to research methodology in the 
context of Gen AI and represents the dominant theme in corpora with 
38.5 %, is an interdisciplinary discussion emphasizing this technology’s 
transformative nature. The most important keywords associated with 
this topic are “generative,” “text,” and “research.” Articles on the subject 
highlight the far-reaching impact of Gen AI, demonstrated by tools such 
as Chat GPT, which generate text and explore domains such as science 
communication, organizational management, and education. Gen AI has 
the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, presenting both 
opportunities and challenges that require thorough research methodol-
ogies for exploration and analysis. Researchers from different fields 
acknowledge the significance of investigating the deployment capabil-
ities, limitations, and ethical concerns of Gen AI (Cole et al., 2022; 
Dwivedi et al., 2023; Sch¨afer, 2023). In the eighth topic, which focuses 
on educational policies and guidelines, the collection of abstracts un-
derscores the significance of creating academic policies and procedures 
that regulate the incorporation of Gen AI technologies, like Chat GPT, in 
higher education institutions (Spivakovsky et al., 2023).
The summaries in the eighth topic, Educational Policies & Guide-
lines, emphasize Gen AI’s potential to revolutionize different facets of 
education, such as teaching, research, and learning technologies. At the 
same time, they recognize the obstacles and ethical considerations that 
accompany its implementation. The scholars stress the importance of 
developing institutional policies that define the appropriate extent of AI 
usage, prevent ethical violations, and foster inclusive environments for 
all participants in the educational process (Qasim & Khalifeh, 2025). 
These policies aim to guide students, lecturers, researchers, and ad-
ministrators in responsibly and effectively using Gen AI tools while 
promoting academic integrity and ethical conduct (Chang et al., 2023; 
Ilieva et al., 2023; Marquez et al., 2023).
Lastly, the ninth topic, the studies on the perception of Gen AI in 
higher education settings, investigates various aspects of its potential 
applications. These include personalized learning experiences, question 
creation and evaluation, academic text composition, and virtual STEM 
classroom assistance (Mohammed et al., 2024). The studies aim to 
comprehend stakeholders’ perspectives, including those of educators, 
university students, and the general public, regarding integrating Gen AI 
into education. The research findings reveal a range of sentiments and 
attitudes among the stakeholders (Ding et al., 2023; So et al., 2023). 
While some express excitement for the innovative uses of Gen AI, others 
voice concerns about its potential misuse and ethical implications. The 
studies also emphasize the need for clear guidelines, professional 
development, and AI literacy education to support the responsible 
integration of Gen AI in teaching and learning contexts (Barrett & Pack, 
2023).
5.1.4. Effect metadata on topics
As stated earlier, the primary contrast between LDA and STMs is the 
ability to include metadata and assess the connection between the 
chosen factors and the topics (Pirri et al., 2020). As shown in Fig. 15, 
which consists of three charts, illustrates the influence of three metadata 
factors, namely the number of citations, research area, and Wo S index, 
on the nine topics related to Gen AI in education. The figure shows the 
average values of the estimated differences, depicted by dots. The hor-
izontal bars show the 95 % confidence intervals of these differences. This 
information provides valuable insights into the relationship between 
these metadata factors and the topics of interest.
Fig. 15’s top left plot presents the estimated proportion of citations 
about nine topics of Gen AI in education. The first plot’s right side dis-
plays the topics cited more frequently, including research methodology, 
education policies, perception of Gen AI in higher education, the po-
tential of AI in education, medical education, and assessment and per-
formance evaluation. These topics could also be hot topics in the field of 
Gen AI use in education. Conversely, academic writing integrity, game- 
based learning, and Gen AI adoption in education are the less-cited 
topics.
Notably, topics related to the perception of Gen AI in higher educa-
tion, the potential of AI in education, academic writing integrity, Gen AI 
adoption in education, and educational policies are more likely to 
appear in non-educational research areas. On the other hand, educa-
tional research is interested in topics such as medical education, game- 
based learning, assessment and performance evaluation, and research 
methodology, as shown in Fig. 15’s plot at the upper right.
The bottom plot of Fig. 15 demonstrates how topics of Gen AI in 
education are distributed across the Wo S indexes. For instance, topics 
related to academic writing integrity, game-based learning, Gen AI 
adoption in education, and perception of Gen AI in higher education are 
more prevalent in the educational science citation index. In contrast, 
topics related to the potential of AI in education, medical education, 
assessment, performance evaluation, and educational policies are spread 
out in the social science citation index. However, topics such as research 
methodology, the potential of AI in education, and game-based learning 
are represented relatively equally in both Wo S indexes.
5.1.5. The correlations between topics
One way to enhance STM-based bibliometric analysis is through 
clustering, which aims to group related themes together. It’s helpful to 
create thematic clusters, which can be curated and observed to gain 
insights into the development of research fields. Various techniques, 
such as hierarchical clustering, can be employed for this purpose (Zupic 
& ˇCater, 2015). In the present study, hierarchical clustering is used by 
converting the correlation matrix to a distance matrix between topics 
and then displaying the thematic clusters/groups on a dendrogram 
chart. Determining the optimal number of groupings for clustering is 
still a matter of research. Nevertheless, dendrograms indicate that 
applying a distance of 1 is a favorable method for identifying the number 
of clusters, yielding a convenient total of 4. Fig. 16 provides a clear 
visualization of the agglomeration clustering structure using a dendro-
gram, highlighting the differentiation between clusters through color

coding, resulting in an easily understandable representation.
In the figure below, the purple cluster consists of two distinct themes: 
the potential of Gen AI in education and its perception within Higher 
Education. This collection of topics investigates Gen AI’s impact on the 
future of education and examines how educators regard this technology 
within the broader educational landscape. Conversely, the orange 
cluster encompasses themes related to educational policies and guide-
lines, emphasizing the necessity of developing academic policies and 
procedures that govern the integration of Gen AI technologies.
Researchers are concentrating on two significant topics within the 
orange cluster: research methodology and game-based learning. They 
explore how Gen AI can serve as a transformative methodology in game- 
based learning across various educational domains. Educators proac-
tively seek innovative ways to incorporate AI technologies into the 
learning experience, potentially enhancing learning outcomes and 
strategies.
The third cluster, represented in blue, includes four key themes: 
Academic Writing Integrity, Medical Education, Gen AI Adoption in 
Education, and Assessment and Performance Evaluation. This cluster 
offers valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of integrating Gen AI 
into medical education. The primary focus is on the accuracy and reli-
ability of Gen AI tools, such as Chat GPT, in generating patient informa-
tion and supporting medical education. While Gen AI models like 
Chat GPT demonstrate considerable promise, addressing challenges such 
as the need for precise information and acknowledging potential limi-
tations for practical application in educational settings is crucial.
6. Discussion
This section examines the alignment of recent findings with estab-
lished research and their significance for educational practices. The 
current investigation provides a comprehensive analysis of the structure 
and content inherent in interdisciplinary Gen AI publications within the 
field of education. Unlike previous reviews that have focused predomi-
nantly on the impact of technology in singular educational domains, 
such as those conducted by Chen et al. (2022), Phillips and Ozogul 
(2020), and Ma et al. (2023), this study endeavors to explore the more 
extensive interdisciplinary ramifications of Gen AI on educational 
research.
According to Bradford’s Law, 13 core sources comprise 33.2 % of the 
literature on Gen AI across educational, medical, and technological do-
mains. Journals’ H-index and G-index indicate that different journals 
have a significant influence on Gen AI in education. Gen AI has provided 
a major focus for global collaboration, particularly between the US, 
China, Australia, and multiple European countries. Between 2021 and 
2024, the USA leads in scholarly collaborations domestically and

internationally, with Australia and China ranking second and third.
Reviewing international research productivity, the USA and China 
are the major contributors, with excellent domestic and international 
collaborations. This is explained by their already set digital frameworks, 
national AI plan, and long-term investments in Ed Tech. Such geopolit-
ical reasons have contributed to an understanding of why research 
outputs on these regions are concentrated, as well as the demonstration 
of a larger trend worldwide regarding innovation leadership (Bataineh 
& Qasim, 2023).
Renowned universities and institutes such as Indiana University, the 
University of Michigan, Charles Sturt University, Deakin University, and 
MIT Institute are leading research on the role of Gen AI in education. 
These developments indicate that Gen AI in education has become a hot 
topic of global significance (Tiwari et al., 2023).
Furthermore, scanning the scientific literature is the key to under-
standing bibliometric trends, with Lotka’s Law helping to understand 
community output and possible new contributors. The authors publish, 
on average, two papers on Gen AI in education. This suggests that the 
field is at a nascent stage (Dalalah & Dalalah, 2023; Vartiainen et al., 
2023). However, the network of collaboration among researchers is 
interlinked, something that bodes well for progress. While low citation 
counts indicate that the field is still in the nascent stage, the increasing 
participation and the growing body of literature are expected to help 
increase the citation counts and, hence, the impact of Gen AI in 
education.
STM is used to identify major topic patterns among summaries of 
Gen AI in education research. Nine critical topics are determined from 
the study on Gen AI in education, which cover a wide range of spectrum 
from the methodology of the study, educational policy, and under-
standing and applications of Gen AI in higher education/medical edu-
cation. The review is, moreover, based on and extends previous review 
endeavors. Previous reviews, such as Bahroun et al. (2023) and Shoja 
et al. (2023), have limited to concrete educational levels or application 
domains. Instead, this study casts a broader net, incorporating data from 
multiple domains (K–12, higher education, and medical education), and 
provides a more comprehensive and generalizable empirical picture of 
Gen AI’s overall effect.
In addition, the topic of “Research Methodology,” making up 38.5 % 
of the corpus, reflects the fact that the area of Gen AI is presently in a 
major research phase. The focus on research methodology signifies the 
need for an in-depth study of the implementation potential, limitations, 
and ethical dimensions of Gen AI technology. An apt example of such a 
focus in the area of education technology research is the use of GANs to 
generate synthetic data that closely mimics actual datasets, thereby 
ensuring data integrity and making possible more rigorous educational 
research (Bethencourt-Aguilar et al., 2023). Moreover, the integration of 
Gen AI into systematic review methods—like the automation of assess-
ments of mobile health apps—demonstrates the methodological 
strengths of applying AI to research, making the process both more 
efficient and accessible (Giunti & Doherty, 2024).
Concrete examples of AI applications in the education sector include 
the use of Chat GPT to improve design practices. The adoption of 
Chat GPT has greatly transformed design cognition and data-driven de-
cision-making processes, making them better and more creative in the 
education sector (Lee & Nah, 2024). Such applications demonstrate the 
revolutionizing potential of AI in education, calling for a strong meth-
odology in research to fully grasp the technology’s complexity as well as 
maximize its benefits. A focus on research methodology is important in 
the quest to study and apply the multifaceted effects of Gen AI in the 
different sectors, particularly in the education system (Dwivedi et al., 
2023).
Moreover, this study contributes to existing studies (e.g., Chan & Lee, 
2023; Chiu, 2023; So et al., 2023) that argue the intricate effects of 
Gen AI on education. It reinforces ethical and practical considerations 
related to the implementation of AI technology in education, echoing 
concerns voiced by researchers about academic integrity, pedagogical 
methods, and policy formulation. Furthermore, recognizing themes 
around medical education and game-based learning indicates the 
growing interest in employing Gen AI in the improvement of teaching- 
and learning processes in a wide range of educational settings.
The study emphasized that a significant challenge in employing 
Gen AI in education is the inherent bias present in these models, which 
can stem from the datasets used for their training (Alkayed & Al-Okaily, 
2024; Currie et al., 2024). Since Gen AI models are typically trained on 
extensive corpora of internet data, they may inadvertently reinforce 
societal biases and stereotypes. This bias can result in unequal repre-
sentation and potential discrimination, particularly in sensitive areas 
such as grading, admissions, or personalized learning.
Enhancing transparency in Gen AI models constitutes another vital 
step in addressing potential ethical and practical challenges. Many of 
these models operate as “black boxes,” resulting in opaque decision- 
making processes that can obscure how conclusions or recommenda-
tions are formed. This lack of transparency may undermine trust and 
complicate educators’ ability to assess the appropriateness of AI-driven 
insights (Kastania, 2024). To counter this issue, policymakers and 
educational institutions could advocate adopting explainable AI (XAI) 
frameworks that illuminate how models arrive at their predictions 
(Alawamreh et al., 2023; Muala et al., 2024; Obeidat, 2022; Sharma 
et al., 2024). Such transparent AI systems would foster trust and 
empower educators to make informed decisions about effectively inte-
grating AI into their practices, ensuring that AI-generated insights align 
with educational objectives while adhering to ethical standards.
The results of the present study do not only specify the scope of 
increased academic interest in Gen AI but also indicate a tide of inno-
vation that transforms educational practice. Gen AI is transforming the 
education field by making formerly impossible educational models 
possible: at the simple end, AI-enhanced tutoring systems and assess-
ments and ad-hoc education simulations that adapt to the student to AI- 
mediated training simulations on the teacher. An application such as 
GPTeach and Khanmigo is a good reflection of how real-time, responsive 
feedback can assist both trains and students in scaled and personalized 
manners. Such innovations can be interpreted as a paradigm shift - from 
the opposite of the fixing and one-size-fits-all instructions to a dynamic, 
learner-powered ecosystem that is driven by AI. The meeting of the two 
worlds, therefore, does not unleash just a technological aspect of 
pedagogy but its deep educational implications that must be further 
researched vis a vis its long-term effects in learning design and institu-
tional transformations.
7. Implications
The study’s theoretical implications highlight several critical aspects 
of the intersection between Gen AI and education. The findings reveal 
the interdisciplinary nature of Gen AI in education research, empha-
sizing the need for collaboration across diverse fields to fully compre-
hend and harness the potential of Gen AI for educational advancement. 
Additionally, the global cooperation observed among countries un-
derscores the widespread recognition of Gen AI’s significance in educa-
tion worldwide. The study’s results provide strong evidence for the 
importance of investing in Gen AI research to ensure its continued 
impact on education and beyond.
Additionally, The Gen AI literature in education has been thoroughly 
analyzed using the STM, revealing nine critical themes, with research 
methodology being the most prominent. Gen AI has the potential to 
revolutionize the education sector, but it also presents significant chal-
lenges and ethical concerns that need to be addressed. As an illustration, 
while AI can provide valuable information to assist students in com-
prehending a subject, more than relying on it without exercising critical 
thinking and problem-solving abilities may impede learning.
The research findings classified these topics into clear groups, 
enhancing our comprehension of the Gen AI landscape in education and 
underscoring the interdisciplinary aspect of this area. Identifying themes 
H. Aldreabi et al.

linked to medical education and game-based learning also highlights the 
increasing enthusiasm for utilizing Gen AI to enhance teaching and 
learning methodologies. This underscores the importance of interdisci-
plinary collaboration in addressing intricate challenges and seizing the 
opportunities presented by Gen AI in education.
7.1. Educational/pedagogical implications
This study examines the literature on Gen AI from an educational 
perspective, utilizing bibliometric and topic models to identify emerging 
trends. In applying the STM methodology, not only were broad themes 
identified, but certain areas of focus also emerged, notably academic 
integrity, policy-oriented modes, and personalized learning, which 
represent the primary characteristics of current teaching topics.
Additional metadata, such as citation analysis and the research 
domain, permitted further differentiation, indicating that the study had 
purely educational interests, as opposed to the rest of the interdisci-
plinary or medical educational studies focusing on research. This fact 
can be useful to decision-makers who plan to introduce adjustments in 
the development of the curriculum and design of policies alongside 
timely changes in education based on evidence.
These analytics may help educators and policymakers: 
• Creating a curriculum with an emphasis on the evolving Gen AI skills 
(critical AI literacy and ethical AI uses).
• The induction of a sense of under-emphasized but critical areas 
(game-based learning and AI-driven formative assessment).
• Knowledge of educational research on an international basis in order 
to guide the national or institutional solutions in terms of bringing 
Gen AI technologies into education.
8. Limitation and further research
It is important to acknowledge specific limitations that may affect 
the generalizability and depth of the findings regarding the role of Gen AI 
in education. A key limitation is the study’s exclusive reliance on the 
Wo S database, which may introduce selection bias by excluding relevant 
studies found in other comprehensive databases, such as Scopus, ERIC, 
or Google Scholar. Each of these databases employs different indexing 
criteria, and depending solely on the Wo S, the results could be skewed 
toward more established or Western-centric publications. Future 
research should utilize multiple data sources to broaden coverage and 
ensure a more representative sample of global research outputs.
Another limitation is the focus on English-language publications, 
which overlooks significant contributions from non-English-speaking 
regions. This linguistic bias can obscure valuable regional perspec-
tives, local innovations, and culturally specific applications of Gen AI in 
the educational context. To address this issue, future research efforts 
should consider incorporating multilingual sources or including trans-
lated studies to capture better the global diversity of Gen AI’s adoption 
and research in education. Another limitation stems from analyzing 
primarily abstracts and metadata rather than full-text articles. Although 
abstracts provide a useful research summary, they often do not 
encompass the methodological nuances, in-depth discussions, and 
context-specific conclusions in full texts. This reliance may lead to su-
perficial interpretations of complex educational phenomena. Future 
investigations would benefit from integrating full-text analyses to obtain 
richer, more nuanced insights.
Furthermore, researchers may encounter technical challenges when 
employing topic modeling methods such as STM, particularly when 
applied to short texts. STM can be sensitive to hyperparameter tuning, 
data sparsity, and variability across academic disciplines. Emerging 
solutions, including deep learning techniques, contextual embeddings, 
and automated tuning algorithms, hold promise for addressing these 
limitations. Future studies should embrace these advancements and 
consider conducting longitudinal analyses to track evolving trends and 
better understand Gen AI’s ethical, pedagogical, and social implications 
in education. By addressing these methodological and linguistic con-
straints, future research can enhance its findings’ validity, generaliz-
ability, and inclusivity, ultimately contributing to the development of 
more robust educational policies and practices on a global scale.
9. Conclusion
Gen AI is becoming a significant topic in global education, with re-
searchers collaborating to explore its potential applications. The current 
study identified nine critical themes of Gen AI in education, highlighting 
its transformative potential and challenges. These themes are catego-
rized into three main areas: integration into medical education, impli-
cations for the future of education, and Gen AI as a revolutionary 
methodology.
The study underscores the evolving nature of the field and the 
emergence of robust collaborative networks among researchers. Edu-
cators must prioritize ethical guidelines concerning data privacy, 
transparency, and bias in Gen AI use to ensure responsible integration. It 
is crucial to engage students in discussions about Gen AI’s ethical im-
plications, as this fosters critical thinking skills and promotes respon-
sible AI use.
Finally, professional development for educators is crucial to equip-
ping them to incorporate Gen AI into teaching practices. Collaborating 
with researchers to create specialized curricula can enhance learning 
experiences. By fostering partnerships among educators, researchers, 
and policymakers, the educational community can harness the potential 
of Gen AI to improve teaching and learning outcomes.
