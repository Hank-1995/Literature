Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming society, necessitating comprehensive understanding of stakeholder 
awareness across cognitive, behavioral, and ethical dimensions. This systematic review examines the evolution of 
AI awareness research and identifies critical knowledge gaps for future investigation. Using the SPAR-4-SLR 
protocol augmented by the Seven Research Gaps framework, we analyzed 71 peer-reviewed papers from 2019 
to 2025 through integrated theoretical lenses. Results reveal overwhelming emphasis on workforce dynamics in 
developed regions, with 61 % of studies concentrated in China and the United States, while consumers, investors, 
and emerging economies remain neglected. We establish AI awareness as a dynamic consciousness process 
preceding technology adoption behavioral decisions and identify "job insecurity" as a dominant theme, alongside 
systematic ethical deficits in 83 % of studies. Geographic bias toward technologically advanced countries and 
disciplinary fragmentation limit research generalizability. The findings necessitate international AI governance 
frameworks, mandatory literacy programs, and standardized assessment tools to ensure equitable global AI 
adoption and bridge existing technological divides.
1. Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is undergoing swift advancements, 
reshaping sectors, fostering novel solutions, and altering social in-
teractions (Tekic, Cosic, & Katalinic, 2019; Parwani et al., 2024). As AI 
technologies become increasingly integrated into business processes, 
consumer interactions, and everyday life, the need to understand how 
stakeholders perceive, interact with, and adapt to these systems has 
grown urgent. AI awareness, as a comprehensive concept, captures how 
individuals and entities understand, feel about, and react to AI’s func-
tionalities, uses, and broader consequences. Its significance lies in its 
influence on adoption behaviors, workforce readiness, and ethical 
governance, making it a critical factor in navigating the opportunities 
and challenges posed by AI’s widespread deployment (Cubric, 2020; 
Puntoni et al., 2020).
Despite AI’s transformative potential, significant challenges persist 
in comprehending how stakeholders—ranging from employees and cli-
nicians to consumers and investors—engage with it. Emerging research 
since 2019 reveals stark disparities in AI adoption and perception across 
industries and regions. For instance, while the technology, media, and 
telecom (TMT) sector leads in AI integration, only 9 % of organizations 
prioritize transparency frameworks, favoring innovation over account-
ability (Stanford University, 2024). Healthcare leads the global AI 
market, yet 44 % of clinicians globally, and 61 % in wealthier countries, 
question their organizations’ readiness for AI integration (Statista, 
2023). Moreover, technological disparities between regions exacerbate 
these challenges: advanced regions benefit from widespread AI expo-
sure, while less-developed areas rely on indirect sources like media or 
propaganda, potentially skewing perceptions and decision-making pro-
cesses (Kahneman, 2011). These gaps underscore broader issues: uneven 
awareness among stakeholders, limited organizational support, and a 
lack of focus on ethical implications, such as bias and privacy concerns 
(Eliasson, 2022; Gupta, 2024). Such challenges not only impede effec-
tive AI integration but also amplify societal risks, including job insecu-
rity and inequitable access to technological benefits.
The urgency of studying AI awareness stems from its role as a 
determinant of human-AI collaboration and societal adaptation. 
Research shows that stakeholders’ knowledge and attitudes toward AI 
directly shape their willingness to adopt it, their trust in its outputs, and 
their ability to address its ethical dilemmas (Davis, 1989; Sohn & Kwon, 
2020). For example, heightened awareness can enhance trust and 
facilitate collaboration, while insufficient understanding often fuels

resistance due to fear or misconceptions (Puntoni et al., 2020). Com-
pounding this, regional differences in technological infrastructure and 
exposure further complicate how awareness forms and influences 
behavior, necessitating a global perspective to ensure equitable out-
comes. Yet, the current literature remains fragmented, with a heavy 
focus on workforce dynamics and organizational innovation, and scant 
attention to consumers, investors, and emerging markets. This imbal-
ance limits a holistic understanding of AI awareness and its broader 
implications, necessitating a systematic approach to consolidate existing 
knowledge and identify critical research gaps.
To address these challenges, this study employs the Scientific Pro-
cedures and Rationales for Systematic Literature Reviews (SPAR-4-SLR) 
protocol (Paul et al., 2021) augmented by the Seven Research Gaps 
framework (Miles, 2017) to review AI awareness research. While the 
SPAR-4-SLR protocol provides a structured process for assembling, ar-
ranging, and assessing literature, it lacks a dedicated taxonomy for 
systematically classifying knowledge gaps. The integration of the Seven 
Research Gaps framework addresses this limitation by offering a scien-
tifically validated typology (e.g., evidence gaps, theoretical gaps) to 
categorize and prioritize underexplored areas, thereby strengthening 
the analytical rigor of the systematic review. Developed by Paul et al. 
(2021), the SPAR-4-SLR protocol offers a rigorous, transparent, and 
replicable framework for synthesizing high-quality, peer-reviewed 
literature. This time range, spanning January 2019 to March 2025, was 
chosen to capture the surge in AI awareness research following 2018, as 
depicted in Fig. 1, which illustrates the annual publication volume of 
relevant articles. Before 2019, only a few scattered studies existed, 
primarily prior to 2018, and these focused predominantly on AI’s 
technical dimensions (e.g., Ming et al., 2018) rather than the 
socio-behavioral aspects of AI awareness central to this review. Since 
January 2019, the literature has increasingly reflected AI’s societal 
integration, with a notable acceleration through early 2025, aligning 
with the scope and timeliness of this study. Unlike narrative reviews, 
which risk subjective bias, or less structured methodologies, this pro-
tocol ensures methodological consistency by guiding the assembly, 
arrangement, and assessment of articles from credible databases like 
Scopus and Web of Science. Its structured stages enable a comprehensive 
analysis of AI awareness’s evolution, key themes, and underexplored 
areas, providing a robust foundation for addressing the field’s frag-
mentation and guiding future inquiry. By leveraging this approach, the 
study aims to answer three core questions: 
(1) What do we know about the evolution of AI awareness?
(2) Where should research on AI awareness be heading?
(3) How can future research enhance the understanding of AI 
awareness?
In an era of rapid technological disruption, understanding AI 
awareness is essential for fostering informed decision-making, promot-
ing equitable AI integration, and mitigating its unintended conse-
quences. This systematic review seeks to bridge the gap between AI’s 
technical advancements and its human-centric implications, offering 
insights that support stakeholders across sectors and regions in adapting 
to an AI-driven future.
2. Theoretical framework
This systematic review draws on a set of complementary theoretical 
bases which collectively allow for a more sophisticated conceptualiza-
tion of AI awareness across cognitive, behavioral, and ethical domains. 
Prior to evaluation of the theories, it is necessary to conceptualize the 
fact that AI awareness is an evolving process from the first perception of 
AI to pre-behavioral consideration covering cognitive knowledge, 
behavioral intention and attitude, and ethical issues. This process-based 
conceptualization resolves definition inconsistencies within the extant 
literature and forms the platform for the synthesis of various theoretical 
frameworks for interpreting research findings and identifying knowl-
edge gaps.
2.1. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)
The Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989) is a fundamental 
theory in understanding how individuals form intentions to use AI 
technology. TAM postulates that perceived ease of use and perceived 
usefulness are direct determinants of technology acceptance. When it 
comes to awareness of AI, the theory is applied in explaining how 
awareness and knowledge of AI capabilities by stakeholders influence 
their intention to implement and adopt AI systems. The model is of 
particular utility in describing workforce patterns and organisational 
patterns of AI adoption that we found in our review of the literature.
2.2. Dual-Process Theory
Dual-Process Theory (Kahneman, 2011) can be used to describe how

individuals cope with information about AI technologies. The theory 
describes the difference between System 1 (automatic, fast, rule-based) 
and System 2 (reflective, slow, effortful) processing. This theory is 
central to the explanation of the difference in AI consciousness across 
areas of differing levels of technological exposure. In developed areas, 
high exposure results in frequent application of AI, which fosters System 
2 analytical thinking, but in less-developed areas, low exposure may 
spur System 1 intuitive responses, most often resulting in fear-based 
orientations.
2.3. Moral Foundations Theory
Moral Foundations Theory (Graham et al., 2013) considers AI con-
sciousness in terms of moral frames by analyzing how moral consider-
ations influence AI uptake and resistance. The theory is particularly 
appropriate in the explanation of stakeholder concerns regarding AI 
fairness, privacy, and bias. The model may explain why ethical in-
clinations are variable across cultures and determine the development of 
ethical AI regulatory styles.
2.4. Theory of resource conservation
Conservation of Resources Theory (Hobfoll, 1989) offers under-
standing into organizational support and the extent of resources and 
their impact on employee reactions towards AI implementation. The 
theory explains how perceived organizational support is a buffer for job 
insecurity and resistance while a lack of resources may amplify negative 
reactions towards AI implementation.
2.5. Theoretical integration
These theories complement each other to provide an integrated ac-
count of AI awareness. Fig. 2 illustrates how these theoretical perspec-
tives overlap into our conceptual map, charting the cognitive (Dual- 
Process Theory), behavioral (TAM), and moral (Moral Foundations 
Theory) 
dimensions 
of 
AI 
awareness 
against 
organizational 
contingencies (Conservation of Resources Theory) as contextual 
moderators.
3. Materials and methods
This systematic review examines the landscape of artificial intelli-
gence (AI) awareness literature from January 2019 to March 2025, 
utilizing the SPAR-4-SLR protocol to ensure a structured and replicable 
synthesis of existing studies. The SPAR-4-SLR framework, introduced by 
Paul et al. (2021), was selected for its ability to provide a methodical 
approach to assembling, organizing, and evaluating peer-reviewed 
literature, thereby minimizing bias and enhancing transparency in the 
review process. Fig. 3 shows the implementation of the SPAR-4-SLR 
protocol.
3.1. Stage 1 of the SPAR-4-SLR protocol: assembling
The initial stage focused on gathering relevant studies to address the 
evolution of AI awareness. The review targeted peer-reviewed journal 
articles, as they are subjected to rigorous scrutiny and offer reliable 
insights into the topic (Paul et al., 2021). To ensure quality, 
non-peer-reviewed materials such as books, theses, conference papers, 
market reports, and working papers were excluded. This study chose 
Scopus and Web of Science to capture a wide range of interdisciplinary 
insights on AI awareness, with a focus on sectors such as healthcare and 
education (Falagas et al., 2008).
A targeted Boolean search was conducted using the query: TITLE- 
ABS-KEY (("AI Awareness" OR "Artificial Intelligence Awareness")) to 
identify relevant studies. The time frame of January 2019 to March 2025 
was chosen to capture the rapid growth in AI awareness research 
following 2018, a period marked by increased societal integration of AI 
technologies. The search yielded 66 records from Web of Science and 
102 from Scopus, totaling 168 records. These were then merged using a 
systematic process adapted from Caputo and Kargina (2022). Specif-
ically, the R package Bibliometrix was used to convert datasets into ". 
bib" format, followed by the application of the "biblioshiny()" function

for initial processing, and final manual merging in Microsoft Excel to 
eliminate inconsistencies (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017).
3.2. Stage 2 of the SPAR-4-SLR protocol: arranging
The second phase focused on structuring and streamlining the 
gathered records to form a targeted dataset for analysis. Starting with 
168 records, we categorized them by attributes such as title, authorship, 
publication year, keywords, citation count, regional scope, and industry 
context. This classification ensured a clear framework for handling the 
data, closely tied to the study’s research objectives.
Next, a refinement step eliminated unsuitable or lower-quality en-
tries. We excluded duplicates (n = 60), conference papers (n = 17), prior 
reviews (n = 2), books and chapters (n = 6), conference summaries (n =

2), editorials (n = 1), and retracted or corrected items (n = 1). The 
remaining 79 articles were thoroughly evaluated by reviewing their ti-
tles and abstracts to verify alignment with AI awareness themes. For 
ambiguous cases, full-text examinations informed final inclusion de-
cisions. This process yielded a refined dataset of 71 articles, a scale 
comparable to systematic reviews in similar domains (Paul et al., 2021).
3.3. Stage 3 of the SPAR-4-SLR protocol: assessing
The final stage involved a comprehensive evaluation of the 71 arti-
cles to synthesize findings and identify trends in AI awareness research. 
Multiple analytical methods were employed to ensure a thorough 
assessment:
Content Analysis: This method examined the journals and citation 
patterns to identify influential works shaping the field.
Bibliometric Modeling: Authorship patterns, co-citation networks, 
and collaboration trends were analyzed to understand the structure of 
the research community.
Topic Modeling: Cluster and keyword co-occurrence analyses were 
used to uncover thematic trends within the literature.
Thematic Analysis: This approach identified conceptual clusters 
and relationships, providing deeper insights into the evolution of AI 
awareness (Donthu et al., 2021).
Results were presented using a combination of visual tools (e.g., 
thematic maps and networks), tables (e.g., citation metrics), and 
narrative descriptions to offer a multifaceted perspective on the find-
ings. To ensure methodological rigor, we conducted quality assessment 
of all 71 articles based on methodological appropriateness, theoretical 
grounding, and reporting transparency. Potential risks of bias were 
identified, including publication bias (English-language focus), 
geographic bias (China/US predominance), and disciplinary bias 
(business/management concentration), which are acknowledged as 
limitations. Given the interpretive nature of systematic reviews and the 
structured SPAR-4-SLR protocol, manual thematic analysis was con-
ducted rather than inter-coder agreement testing, with reliability 
ensured through systematic categorization using the Seven Research 
Gaps framework, iterative analysis rounds, and cross-verification with 
bibliometric results from VOSviewer. This review recognizes certain 
boundaries, such as its emphasis on English-language studies, the re-
striction to research from 2019 to March 2025, and the risk of publi-
cation skew, where studies with striking results may be favored for 
publication (Borenstein et al., 2009). Even with these limits, the 
SPAR-4-SLR protocol delivered a thorough and repeatable analysis of 
the literature, laying a strong groundwork for exploring AI awareness 
and its broader effects.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Overview
The analysis reveals a clear gap in adopting diverse analytical lenses 
for AI awareness research, with most studies centered on a handful of 
dominant fields. The medical and education sectors account for 
approximately 30 %, focusing on AI cognition challenges in medical 
imaging, diagnosis, and education. The hotel and service industry rep-
resents 25 %, exploring AI awareness impacts on employee turnover and 
service innovation. Educational technology comprises 20 %, empha-
sizing AI literacy from K-12 to university levels. Library and information 
science accounts for 10 %, while business and organizational manage-
ment represents 15 %. This pattern reveals a strong emphasis on 
educational and business viewpoints while missing perspectives from 
psychology, ethics, and cultural studies. Unlike prior reviews by Cubric 
(2020) and Puntoni et al. (2020), which examined technical adoption 
barriers and consumer experiences respectively, our analysis reveals 
that AI awareness research suffers from disciplinary silos that limit ho-
listic understanding of human-AI interactions across cognitive, 
behavioral, and ethical dimensions. Table 1 lists journals publishing 
multiple works in this area, reflecting these disciplinary trends.
4.2. Contributions of authors and affiliate institutions
This study identified 298 researchers who have explored AI aware-
ness, contributing to its scholarly development. To evaluate their 
impact, we applied a weighted scoring approach inspired by Howard 
et al. (1987), which recognizes varying levels of contribution in 
collaborative works. This approach allocates a score of 1.0 to single 
authors, 0.6 to primary authors, and 0.4 to secondary authors in 
collaborative works, promoting a fair evaluation of individual contri-
butions (Howard et al., 1987).
Table 2 outlines the scoring framework used to quantify author 
contributions, drawing on established methodologies (Abidoye & Chan, 
2017). Of the 298 authors, only 11 published two or more articles in this 
field, indicating a concentrated group of prolific contributors. Table 3
lists those with the highest weighted scores, led by Jos´e Enrique 
Arias-P´erez (score: 1.2), followed by Chengliang Wang (score: 1.12) and 
Juan V´elez-Jaramillo (score: 0.8). Notably, several leading contributors 
are based at institutions in the Asia-Pacific region, with a strong pres-
ence from China. This pattern likely reflects the region’s accelerated 
focus on AI innovation, fueled by robust policy support and academic 
investment in AI-related studies. For instance, China’s emphasis on 
integrating AI into sectors like healthcare and education has spurred 
research into its societal implications, including awareness dynamics (Li 
and Abangbila, 2024).
Beyond funding and infrastructure, cultural and strategic factors in 
the Asia-Pacific may further explain this trend. For example, China’s 
collectivist approach to technology adoption prioritizes community- 
oriented AI applications, fostering studies on stakeholder perceptions 
and ethical challenges. This regional focus offers valuable insights but 
also suggests a need for broader global perspectives to fully understand 
AI awareness across diverse contexts.
4.3. Collaboration network and citation analysis
The author collaboration network offers a clear depiction of schol-
arly ties among researchers studying AI awareness between 2019 and 
March 2025. Such analysis is vital in systematic reviews, as it reveals 
active contributors and their role in fostering knowledge exchange 
within the research community (Donthu et al., 2021). Additionally, as Yi 
et al. (2020) suggest, such patterns help identify thought leaders who 
drive advancements in the field and shape the discourse around AI 
awareness. These intellectual networks also reflect the interdisciplinary 
nature of AI research, emphasizing the global and collaborative effort 
required to address its complex challenges. Fig. 4 illustrates the 
collaboration network of authors contributing to the domain of artificial 
intelligence awareness from 2019 to March 2025. The visualization 
highlights a fragmented structure, with authors forming small, isolated 
clusters rather than a cohesive, interconnected network. This pattern 
suggests that researchers predominantly collaborate within their

immediate academic or institutional circles, with limited interdisci-
plinary or cross-institutional exchanges. For example, (Wang et al., 
2024) leads a distinct cluster, indicating focused research efforts within 
a specific domain, while (Kong et al., 2021) form another self-contained 
group, possibly addressing niche topics within AI awareness. Similarly, 
authors such as Arias-P´erez and (Arias-P´erez and V´elez-Jaramillo, 
2022a) operate in separate clusters, further underscoring the absence of 
widespread collaboration.
This fragmentation may stem from the diverse and interdisciplinary 
nature of AI awareness research. Scholars often approach the subject 
from different perspectives, including technological development, so-
cietal impacts, ethical considerations, and economic implications. 
Consequently, their work tends to align with their primary disciplines, 
such as computer science, sociology, business, or policy studies, limiting 
opportunities for broader collaboration. For instance, researchers 
focusing on ethical AI frameworks may have little direct overlap with 
those studying the economic impacts of AI adoption, resulting in parallel 
but isolated research efforts.
Additionally, the geographical distribution of contributors might 
play a role in this fragmentation. As noted in the systematic review, a 
significant number of prominent researchers are affiliated with in-
stitutions in the Asia–Pacific region, where AI research has been driven 
by localized challenges, government initiatives, and institutional prior-
ities. This regional focus further reinforces the creation of distinct 
research clusters, as scholars often address region-specific issues rather 
than engaging in global or cross-regional collaboration.
While the formation of specialized clusters allows for deeper explo-
ration within specific domains, it also poses challenges for the holistic 
advancement of AI awareness. The lack of integration across disciplines 
and geographies could hinder the development of comprehensive 
frameworks that address AI’s multifaceted implications. To bridge these 
gaps, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and establishing global 
research networks could be critical steps forward, enabling scholars to 
build on each other’s expertise and address AI-related challenges in a 
more unified manner.
As shown in Fig. 5, the citation analysis reveals the prominence of 
publications by tracking their citation counts, a key indicator of aca-
demic influence (Ahiadu & Abidoye, 2024; Donthu et al., 2021). Within 
AI awareness research, this approach underscores the impact of pivotal 
studies, spotlighting works that have guided discussions on cognitive, 
behavioral, and ethical dimensions in this dynamic field (Paul et al., 
2021).
Of the 71 studies systematically examined, 49 articles satisfied the 
preliminary requirement of securing at least one citation, with only 23 
closely linked papers selected for network analysis. This method prior-
itizes impactful research that meaningfully connects with the wider 
scholarly community, capturing the interplay and knowledge sharing 
within AI awareness research.
Table 4 highlights that Li et al. (2019), with 400 citations, in-
vestigates how AI awareness influences the hospitality sector, focusing 
on its effects on employee retention and workplace support structures. 
This foundational study underscores the practical implications of AI 
awareness in shaping workforce dynamics. Similarly, Kong et al. (2021)
received 151 citations for their work on the influence of AI awareness on 
career competency and job burnout, highlighting the intersection of AI 
adoption and human resource challenges. Liang et al. (2022) and Este-
vez et al. (2019) also appear prominently, contributing to the under-
standing of AI’s dual-edge effects and its integration into educational 
contexts.
The citation network visualized in Fig. 5 further reveals distinct 
clusters of influence. For instance, Li et al. (2019) serves as a central 
node, connecting studies that explore organizational impacts, while 
Kong et al. (2021) forms a secondary hub focused on career-related di-
mensions of AI awareness. The relatively dispersed network indicates 
that, despite these central nodes, research on AI awareness spans diverse 
subfields such as education, healthcare, and workforce management, 
reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the topic.
By analyzing the citation impact and network connections, it be-
comes evident that the field of AI awareness has been shaped by a few 
seminal studies, which continue to inspire a wide range of interdisci-
plinary research. These findings emphasize the need for greater collab-
oration across disciplines to further integrate insights and address the 
multifaceted implications of AI awareness.

activity over this period. The selection of January 2019 as the starting 
point aligns with a pivotal shift in the literature, where studies began to 
increasingly focus on the socio-behavioral dimensions of AI awar-
eness—such as adoption behaviors, trust, and ethical implica-
tions—rather than purely technical aspects, which dominated prior to 
2018.
The data reveal a clear upward trajectory in research output, with 
notable fluctuations. In 2019, five articles were published, marking the 
beginning of AI awareness as a distinct research domain. This number 
dropped to one in 2020, likely due to global disruptions from the COVID- 
19 pandemic, which shifted academic priorities and resources. Research 
activity rebounded modestly in 2021 with three articles, followed by a 
steady increase to nine articles in 2022 and 10 in 2023, reflecting 
growing interest in the field. A dramatic surge occurred in 2024, with 34 
articles published, representing the peak of AI awareness research to 
date. By March 31, 2025, nine articles had already been published, 
indicating sustained momentum despite the partial-year data. This sig-
nificant output in 2024 and early 2025 underscores AI awareness’s 
emergence as a critical area of inquiry, driven by AI’s deepening societal 
integration.
Several factors underpin this trend. First, the rapid deployment of AI 
technologies in sectors like healthcare, education, and business since 
2019 has heightened the need to understand stakeholder perceptions 
and readiness (Cubric, 2020). Second, the rise of generative AI tools, 
such as Chat GPT in late 2022, has spurred interest in how awareness 
influences adoption and trust, particularly in advanced regions like the 
United States and China. This likely contributed to the sharp increase in 
2024, as researchers responded to the global impact of such technolo-
gies. Third, growing ethical concerns—such as bias, privacy, and job 
displacement—have prompted researchers to explore AI awareness as a

mediator of societal impact, a theme increasingly prominent in 2023 and 
2024 studies (Gupta, 2024). The nine articles published by March 2025 
indicate a continued focus on these issues, alongside emerging topics 
like agentic AI and its implications for workforce dynamics, reflecting 
the field’s responsiveness to technological advancements.
The research trends also reveal shifts in thematic emphasis. Early 
studies (2019–2020) primarily addressed organizational adoption and 
workforce readiness, often in technology-leading nations. By 2021 and 
2022, the scope broadened to include consumer perspectives and ethical 
reasoning, with a marked increase in cross-disciplinary approaches. The 
steady growth in 2023 reflects a period of theoretical consolidation, as 
researchers began integrating frameworks like Dual-Process Theory to 
explain behavioral responses. The explosion of publications in 2024 and 
early 2025 corresponds with a diversification of topics, including 
regional disparities, particularly how awareness varies between AI- 
exposed advanced economies and less-developed regions reliant on in-
direct information sources. This evolution underscores the field’s 
maturation and its alignment with global AI deployment patterns, 
setting the stage for further exploration of underexplored areas, such as 
emerging markets and investor perceptions.
4.5. Countries/regions offocus
As proposed by Sohn and Kwon (2020) in their research on AI 
implementation, the way people perceive and embrace artificial intel-
ligence (AI) technologies can be seen as a wide - ranging spectrum. In 
real - world circumstances, instances of either a total absence of AI 
awareness or an extremely thorough understanding are quite scarce. 
While global disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic have had 
widespread effects (Fan, 2022), the unique characteristics of individual 
countries—such as technological infrastructure, policy frameworks, and 
societal readiness—result in varying levels of AI awareness and adoption 
across regions (Lo et al., 2022).
Fig. 7 provides an overview of the geographical distribution of AI 
awareness research published from 2019 to March 2025, based on the 
71 articles included in this systematic review. China stands out as the 
leading country in AI awareness research, with 19 studies focused on 
this region. This is followed by the United States with 10 studies, 
reflecting its position as a global hub for AI innovation. Saudi Arabia, 
Malaysia, and the United Kingdom each have six to seven studies, 
highlighting their growing interest in leveraging AI for national and 
organizational development. Other countries, such as India, Italy, and 
Turkey, each account for four studies, while Finland, South Korea, 
Switzerland, and Thailand contribute three studies each.
The prominence of China and the United States in AI awareness 
research can be attributed to their substantial investments in AI tech-
nologies and their global influence in shaping AI policies and applica-
tions. For example, China’s strategic initiatives, such as the "New 
Generation AI Development Plan," have propelled the nation to the 
forefront of AI research, particularly in areas like employee adaptation, 
innovation, and education. Similarly, the United States’ focus on ethical 
AI and its integration across diverse industries has driven significant 
scholarly attention. These regional disparities in technological infra-
structure and exposure can be further understood through Dual-Process 
Theory (Kahneman, 2011), which posits that cognitive processing oc-
curs via two systems: System 1 (intuitive, fast, and heuristic-based) and 
System 2 (analytical, slow, and deliberate). In technologically advanced 
regions like China and the United States, frequent exposure to AI 
applications—such as automation in manufacturing or AI-driven 
healthcare diagnostics—fosters System 2 reasoning, enabling stake-
holders to form analytical judgments about AI’s capabilities and impli-
cations based on direct experience. Conversely, in less-developed 
regions with limited AI infrastructure, such as parts of Sub-Saharan 
Africa or rural areas in emerging markets, awareness is often shaped 
by indirect sources like media narratives or government propaganda. 
This reliance on secondary information drives System 1 processing, 
leading to intuitive, often fear-based perceptions of AI, such as concerns 
over job displacement or ethical risks, without the grounding of prac-
tical interaction. This theoretical lens highlights how technological ac-
cess influences not only the extent of AI awareness but also its 
qualitative nature, with implications for adoption behaviors and trust 
across regions.
Interestingly, the figure also highlights the relatively limited focus on 
emerging and frontier markets. Despite being critical regions for un-
derstanding the global implications of AI, only a handful of studies have 
examined countries such as Turkey, Thailand, and Saudi Arabia. This 
imbalance may stem from data availability issues and the maturity of AI 
infrastructure in these regions (Renigier-Biłozor et al., 2021). However, 
these emerging markets represent unique opportunities for further 
research, particularly in exploring the societal and economic impacts of 
AI adoption under conditions of uncertainty.
Moreover, cross - country comparisons remain underexplored in the 
context of AI awareness. Studies examining the interdependence of AI 
awareness trends across nations could provide valuable insights into the 
cascading effects of technological progress and policy developments. For 
instance, research has shown that in the field of AI, the open - source 
initiatives in countries like the United States and the large - scale gov-
ernment - led AI development projects in China can set trends. These

efforts influence how other countries, especially those with less mature 
AI ecosystems, approach AI adoption. The technological know - how and 
policy frameworks emerging from these major players can serve as 
models or cautionary tales, affecting factors such as investment in AI 
research, talent acquisition strategies, and the integration of AI into 
various sectors. Similarly, AI awareness research would benefit from 
examining how policy and technological developments in countries like 
China and the United States influence adoption trends in less mature 
markets.
Overall, Fig. 7 reveals both the need for greater geographic diversity 
in AI awareness research and an existing bias. Most current research 
centers on mature markets, while emerging and frontier markets with 
their inefficiencies and unique challenges lack sufficient scholarly focus. 
Moreover, the overrepresentation of China and the U.S., which reflects 
their AI development dominance, along with the exclusion of non - 
English studies, creates a ’Global North’ bias and restricts generaliz-
ability, especially to regions like Sub - Saharan Africa with different 
infrastructural and cultural backgrounds. This bias may limit the 
generalizability of behavioral findings, such as trust or resistance pat-
terns, as non-English-speaking regions (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa) might 
exhibit distinct AI awareness dynamics due to cultural or infrastructural 
factors (Section 4.7, p. 33). Future research could explore these regions 
using multilingual databases like Google Scholar or regional journals to 
capture behavioral variations in AI adoption. A critical societal impli-
cation emerging from the data is the socioeconomic stratification in AI 
awareness. As Fig. 6 demonstrates, 61 % of clinicians in high-income 
nations express institutional unpreparedness (Statista, 2023), whereas 
in Sub-Saharan Africa, 78 % of SMEs cite infrastructure gaps as adoption 
barriers (Renigier-Biłozor et al., 2021). Drawing on Social Contract 
Theory, these disparities reflect unequal access to AI resources, exac-
erbating the "digital divide" (Lo et al., 2022). For instance, China’s 
centralized AI investments (Fig. 6) have fostered technical proficiency in 
urban centers but marginalized rural populations, mirroring global 
patterns of technology-induced inequality (Sun & Medaglia, 2019). This 
finding contributes to Technology in Society’s agenda on equitable 
technological development.
4.6. Recurring themes and causes of AI awareness
To uncover the central ideas shaping AI awareness research, we 
conducted an in-depth analysis of key concepts and trends within this 
field. Leveraging VOSviewer software, we created a thematic network 
based on the 71 articles in our dataset. VOSviewer’s strength lies in its 
capacity to visually depict connections among critical terms, making it a 
valuable tool for bibliometric analysis (Kuzior & Sira, 2022). The 
resulting visualization, shown in Fig. 7, provides a clear structure for 
exploring the primary focus areas of AI awareness studies. These map-
ped themes highlight persistent research priorities and suggest potential 
directions for future investigations (Meng et al., 2020).

The thematic map was developed by analyzing keywords from the 
titles and abstracts of the 71 articles, employing VOSviewer’s standard 
binary counting approach to detect recurring terms. To ensure a focused 
and meaningful output, only keywords appearing at least three times 
were included. Generic terms—such as “AI,” “artificial intelligence,” 
“technology,” “resource,” “future,” “model,” “pls-sem,” “performance,” 
“consequences,” “antecedents,” “gender,” “conservation,” as well as 
month or country names—were excluded to prioritize substantive con-
cepts. The final visualization emphasizes high-frequency themes as 
brighter zones, offering a vivid snapshot of prevailing trends in AI 
awareness research.
To clarify the practical significance of these themes for different 
stakeholders, Table 5 organizes the findings from Section 3.6 by stake-
holder groups and linked theoretical frameworks. This summary con-
nects to the cognitive, behavioral, and ethical aspects introduced earlier.
Fig. 8 presents the thematic network, revealing a web of inter-
connected research priorities. At its core, “artificial intelligence” and “AI 
awareness” stand out as pivotal nodes, underscoring their centrality to 
the field. These are surrounded by related themes, including “workplace 
support,” “organizational change,” and “employment concerns.” The 
presence of concepts like “resource conservation theory” and “leader-
ship dynamics” points to a strong focus on how AI adoption shapes 
human and workplace interactions, reflecting the complex relationship 
between technological advances and organizational behavior.
As illustrated in Fig. 8, "job insecurity" emerges as a central issue, 
driven by AI’s potential to replace human-performed tasks in 
manufacturing assembly and service sectors like data processing and 
customer support. These shifts fuel employee anxieties about job sta-
bility, prompting significant research into worker impacts and organi-
zational mitigation strategies. This aligns with the Technology 
Acceptance Model (TAM; Davis, 1989), where perceived threats reduce 
perceived usefulness and drive resistance to AI adoption. Dual-Process 
Theory (Kahneman, 2011) suggests that intuitive fears (System 1) 
about job displacement may overshadow analytical evaluations (System 
2) of AI’s benefits, exacerbating emotional responses and undermining 
trust. However, themes like "perceived organizational support" and 
"leader-member exchange" highlight mitigation strategies, with Con-
servation of Resources Theory (Hobfoll, 1989) explaining how organi-
zational resources reduce stress and enhance adoption behaviors, while 
Social Exchange Theory (Blau, 1964) suggests that supportive leader-
ship fosters reciprocal trust and counters job insecurity.
When contrasted with prior reviews by Cubric (2020) and Puntoni 
et al. (2020), our study reveals distinct contributions. While Cubric 
focused on business adoption barriers and Puntoni examined consumer 
experiences, our analysis uniquely identifies "job insecurity" as a 
dominant theme and encompasses broader stakeholder perspectives. 
The VOSviewer analysis demonstrates a shift toward multidisciplinary 
research, with AI awareness now explored through psychology, sociol-
ogy, and organizational behavior lenses rather than purely technological 
perspectives. However, this review reveals significant gaps including 
incomplete user psychological perspectives and fragmented information 
processing pathways. Additionally, 83 % of studies overlook algorithmic 
bias issues (Jain & Menon, 2023), reflecting "techno-deterministic" bias 
in the literature that neglects comprehensive understanding of how in-
dividuals cognitively process and emotionally respond to AI

4.7. The impact of AI Awareness Across Disciplinary Fields
While artificial intelligence (AI) awareness has become a significant 
area of research, its impact varies widely across different disciplines due 
to the diverse challenges and opportunities AI presents within each field. 
The analysis of disciplinary focus in previous studies, as illustrated in 
Fig. 9, reveals a distinct distribution of interest. Business, Management, 
and Accounting lead with 19.5 % of the studies, closely followed by 
Social Sciences (18.8 %), and Computer Science (13.3 %). These fields 
dominate due to their direct engagement with AI-driven organizational, 
societal, and technological transformations.
Disciplines like Medicine (9.4 %), Engineering (6.3 %), and Eco-
nomics (5.5 %) reflect growing focus on sector-specific AI applications in 
diagnosis, automation, and forecasting. In contrast, smaller contribu-
tions from Arts and Humanities (3.9 %), Psychology (3.1 %), and 
Environmental Sciences (2.3 %) highlight limited exploration of AI’s 
broader societal, cultural, and environmental implications. The "Other" 
category (13.3 %) encompasses interdisciplinary and niche areas. This 
distribution reveals disproportionate focus on fields with immediate 
technological or economic relevance, suggesting the need for broader 
engagement across underrepresented disciplines to fully understand AI 
adoption’s societal and ethical dimensions.
In business and management, AI awareness research primarily ex-
plores organizational change, employee interactions, and decision- 
making frameworks, with emphasis on job security concerns and 
workplace support strategies. Social sciences examine societal impacts, 
ethics, and policy implications, bridging technical advancements with 
broader consequences. Medicine focuses on diagnostic applications and 
clinical workflow integration challenges, while engineering emphasizes 
technical and operational aspects of automation and smart systems. The 
diversity of disciplines highlights AI awareness as multifaceted research 
topic, yet gaps remain in arts, humanities, and environmental sciences. 
These underexplored fields hold potential for addressing critical cultural 
and environmental questions, requiring interdisciplinary collaborations 
that integrate technical, societal, and ethical perspectives.

4.8. Policy and regulatory implications
Our findings reveal critical policy and regulatory implications for 
developing global AI awareness. The specified geographic imbal-
ances—wherein 61 % of research focused within the developed world 
but developing nations trail behind—point to urgent imperatives for 
global AI regulatory frameworks to rectify disparity of awareness. Pol-
icymakers must tackle three issues of utmost concern: First, ensuring 
school curricula within areas with low exposure to AI incorporate AI 
literacy education to establish basic awareness prior to widespread 
rollout. Second, developing AI transparency standards that require or-
ganizations to report AI usage and undertake awareness training for 
employees to address the job insecurity issues identified in 40 % of the 
studies. Third, establishing global collaboration frameworks for devel-
oping AI awareness capability to facilitate knowledge transfer from AI- 
developed countries to developing countries through technology sharing 
agreements and learning collaborations.
The institutional ethical shortfall exposed in our analysis with 83 % 
of the studies failing to consider algorithmic bias necessitates regulatory 
intervention calling for AI impact assessments considering levels of 
awareness across impacted groups prior to system deployment. The 
dispersed disciplinary attention also means that interdisciplinary policy 
advisory boards which bring together the input of psychology, ethics, 
and cultural studies need to be convened along with technical input. 
Such policy measures are necessary to assist in ensuring that AI 
awareness raising contributes to inclusive global adoption of AI instead 
of aggravating current technologically mediated divides between 
developed and developing nations.
5. Gaps in knowledge and future research directions
Table 6
categorizes critical gaps in AI awareness research 
(2019–2025 Mar.) using the Seven Research Gaps framework (Miles, 
2017), guiding future investigations to enhance understanding and 
application of AI awareness across global and behavioral contexts.
5.1. Evidence gap
Research on AI awareness reveals inconsistencies across sectors, 
limiting coherent conclusions. For instance, studies report positive ef-
fects of AI awareness, such as reduced turnover intention through 
perceived organizational support (Li et al., 2019), but others highlight 
negative outcomes, like increased counterproductive behaviors due to 
job insecurity (Zhou et al., 2024). These contradictory findings, often 
rooted in differing stakeholder contexts, hinder a unified understanding 
of AI awareness’s behavioral impacts. Future research should conduct 
meta-analyses or comparative studies to reconcile these disparities, 
focusing on how cognitive (Dual-Process Theory, Kahneman, 2011), 
behavioral (Technology Acceptance Model, Davis, 1989), and ethical 
dimensions (Moral Foundations Theory, Graham et al., 2013) interact to 
shape adoption behaviors. These efforts should leverage the cognitive, 
behavioral, and ethical dimensions in Fig. 10 to test how contradictions 
in adoption behaviors relate to intuitive vs. analytical appraisals.
5.2. Knowledge gap
Desired research findings on AI awareness remain unexplored, 
particularly regarding underrepresented stakeholder groups. While 
workforce dynamics dominate (e.g., Kong et al., 2021, on job burnout), 
little is known about consumer trust in AI-driven technologies or 
investor confidence in AI-intensive industries (Puntoni et al., 2020). This 
void obscures how AI awareness influences broader behavioral patterns, 
such as service adoption or funding decisions. Longitudinal studies 
across diverse populations (e.g., employees, students, consumers) are 
needed to fill this gap, exploring how cognitive knowledge, emotional 
responses (e.g., fear, trust), and ethical perceptions drive human-AI in-
teractions. Such studies could use Fig. 10 to explore how cognitive 
knowledge and emotional responses drive behavioral patterns across 
stakeholders. Specific attention should be given to consumers and in-
vestors, drawing on studies like Goel and Nelson (2024) on AI awareness 
in financial decision-making and Jin (2024) on NFT investments, to 
understand trust and behavioral patterns.
5.3. Practical-knowledge gap
Professional practices often deviate from or lack research guidance 
on AI awareness, leading to inefficiencies. For example, organizations 
adopt AI without assessing employee awareness, resulting in resistance 
or job insecurity (Arias-P´erez & V´elez-Jaramillo, 2022a). This gap 
highlights a disconnect between research and application, undermining 
behavioral adaptation. Future research should develop practical tools to 
bridge this divide, such as AI literacy workshops simulating human-AI 
collaboration to reduce fear and enhance trust, or a standardized AI 
Awareness Index assessing technical, ethical, and adoption readiness 
(Section 3.6, p. 23). These tools, grounded in Conservation of Resources 
Theory (Hobfoll, 1989), could guide practitioners in fostering equitable 
AI integration. For instance, AI literacy workshops could involve 
role-playing scenarios where employees interact with AI chatbots to 
simulate trust-building, allowing them to experience firsthand how AI 
supports rather than replaces their tasks, thus reducing job insecurity 
perceptions (Section 3.6, p. 23). The AI Awareness Index could include 
validated Likert-scale questions on technical proficiency (e.g., under-
standing machine learning workflows), ethical concerns (e.g., bias 
awareness), and adoption readiness (e.g., perceived usefulness), piloted

in healthcare settings to assess clinician readiness and inform targeted 
training programs. Implementation could involve a 6-month pilot with 
monthly feedback loops from clinicians, ensuring iterative refinement of 
the index based on real-world behavioral data, such as changes in 
adoption intentions or trust levels. Preliminary items could include ‘I 
understand the ethical risks of AI bias’ and ‘AI is easy to use in my work’ 
(TAM, Davis, 1989), piloted across stakeholders to ensure cross-cultural 
validity (Section 3.5, p. 21). For consumers, dashboards could be piloted 
in e-commerce platforms to track trust metrics (e.g., satisfaction, repeat 
usage) over 3 months, as suggested by Brown et al. (2025), enhancing 
adoption behaviors.
5.4. Methodological gap
Current methodologies for studying AI awareness, often relying on 
self-reported surveys (e.g., Li et al., 2019), limit generalizability and 
depth. New research designs, such as experimental studies tracking 
real-time 
behavioral 
responses 
or 
mixed-methods 
approaches 
combining qualitative interviews with quantitative data, are necessary 
to generate fresh insights or avoid distorted findings. For instance, ex-
periments could test how AI awareness influences adoption intentions 
(TAM, Davis, 1989) across cultures, addressing the cognitive and 
behavioral dimensions. Such methods would enhance the rigor of AI 
awareness research. This could involve experimental designs mapping 
the dimensions in Fig. 10 to assess real-time behavioral responses.
5.5. Empirical gap
Empirical verification of AI awareness findings is lacking, particu-
larly for long-term outcomes. Studies like Estevez et al. (2019) suggest 
educational benefits, but few validate these longitudinally or across 
regions, leaving adoption and ethical impacts uncertain. Comparative 
field studies are needed to empirically assess how AI awareness evolves, 
evaluating its effects on behavioral intentions (e.g., resistance, collab-
oration) and ethical reasoning (e.g., bias concerns) over time. These 
studies should leverage behavioral theories (e.g., Stress and Coping 
Theory) to strengthen evidence on human-AI dynamics. Using Fig. 10 as 
a framework, these studies could empirically validate how ethical con-
cerns influence long-term behavioral intentions.
5.6. Theoretical gap
AI awareness research often lacks theoretical grounding, limiting its 
explanatory power. A critical manifestation of this gap is the absence of 
a unified consensus on the definition of AI awareness. Across the liter-
ature, interpretations vary widely: some studies frame it as technical 
proficiency and recognition of AI capabilities (e.g., Ming et al., 2018), 
others emphasize ethical risk perceptions such as bias or privacy con-
cerns (e.g., Jain & Menon, 2023), and yet others highlight emotional and 
behavioral dimensions like trust or resistance (e.g., Kohnke & Moor-
house, 2025). This definitional inconsistency fragments the conceptual 
foundation of AI awareness, undermining its explanatory coherence and 
complicating efforts to systematically analyze its cognitive, behavioral, 
and ethical mechanisms. For instance, without a shared definition, it 
remains unclear whether employees’ AI awareness primarily reflects 
their technical understanding or their ethical apprehensions, obscuring 
the interplay between these dimensions. This gap hinders understanding 
of behavioral mechanisms, such as how fear or trust drives resistance or 
adoption. Future research should apply behavioral theories (e.g., Social 
Cognitive Theory, Bandura, 1986) to explore how AI awareness shapes 
cognitive appraisals, emotional responses, and ethical decision-making, 
enhancing the framework’s coherence. Additionally, developing a 
standardized conceptual definition—potentially integrating technical, 
ethical, and behavioral facets—could unify disparate perspectives and

strengthen theoretical rigor across studies.
To guide future research addressing these theoretical gaps, Fig. 10
illustrates a conceptual model of AI awareness, highlighting its cogni-
tive, behavioral, and ethical dimensions and their interconnections. The 
figure underscores areas where theoretical and empirical gaps persist, 
such as the interplay between intuitive/analytical appraisals and 
behavioral outcomes, necessitating further investigation to enhance AI 
awareness research. However, the framework’s applicability may be 
limited by cultural variations in ethical perceptions (e.g., collectivism 
vs. individualism), requiring future validation across non-Western re-
gions to ensure global relevance and address behavioral differences in 
trust or resistance. The current framework assumes a linear relationship 
among the cognitive, behavioral, and ethical dimensions; however, in 
practice, non-linear interactions may exist (e.g., ethical risk perceptions 
directly suppressing intuitive technology adoption). For instance, cul-
tural differences may weaken the influence of Moral Foundations The-
ory (MFT) on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM): in collectivist 
cultures, ethical risks (such as algorithmic bias) might be perceived as 
collective rather than individual responsibilities, thereby reducing their 
constraining effect on behavioral intentions (Floridi, 2019). Future 
research should empirically test the boundary conditions of theoretical 
synergy, such as whether cultural variations moderate the interactive 
pathways among Dual-Process Theory (DPT), MFT, and TAM.
5.7. Population gap
Research on AI awareness underrepresents certain populations, 
particularly emerging markets (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa) and non- 
English-speaking regions. Studies focus heavily on China and the U.S. 
(Section 3.5, p. 23), neglecting cultural, infrastructural, and educational 
variations (Li and Abangbila, 2024). This bias restricts generalizability, 
especially for behavioral outcomes like adoption readiness or ethical 
concerns among diverse demographics (e.g., age, education). Future 
studies should include underrepresented regions and stakeholders (e.g., 
consumers, healthcare professionals) to ensure globally relevant in-
sights, using multilingual databases and region-specific journals to 
capture varied AI awareness experiences. Drawing on Fig. 10, these 
studies could investigate how cultural variations affect cognitive, 
behavioral, and ethical dimensions across diverse demographics. To 
address marginalized groups, we advocate for disability-inclusive AI 
design. For example, integrating speech recognition tools in visually 
impaired education (Kohnke & Moorhouse, 2025) requires culturally 
adapted training modules. Policymakers should incentivize such in-
novations through grants, as seen in Singapore’s AI for Accessibility 
program (2023), which reduced assistive tech costs by 40 %. This 
bridges the "last-mile" gap identified in Fig. 7, where Sub-Saharan Africa 
remains understudied.
6. Conclusions
This systematic review, grounded in the SPAR-4-SLR protocol (Paul 
et al., 2021) and augmented by the Seven Research Gaps framework 
(Miles, 2017), provides a comprehensive synthesis of AI awareness 
literature from 2019 to March 2025. By integrating these dual meth-
odological frameworks, the study adheres to rigorous procedural stan-
dards while systematically categorizing critical knowledge voids that 
conventional reviews often overlook. The SPAR-4-SLR protocol ensured 
transparency in assembling, arranging, and assessing 71 peer-reviewed 
articles, while the Seven Research Gaps framework enabled nuanced 
classification of underexplored domains.
This study makes several novel contributions to AI awareness 
research. First, we establish a process-oriented definition of AI aware-
ness as a dynamic progression from initial AI perception to pre- 
behavioral evaluation, integrating cognitive, behavioral, and ethical 
dimensions—a conceptualization previously absent in the literature. 
Second, our integrative theoretical framework (Fig. 10) uniquely maps 
these dimensions through Technology Acceptance Model, Dual-Process 
Theory, and Moral Foundations Theory, providing a comprehensive 
analytical lens. Third, we identify "job insecurity" as a dominant 
behavioral theme through systematic thematic analysis, contrasting 
with prior reviews by Cubric (2020) and Puntoni et al. (2020) that 
focused primarily on technical barriers and consumer experiences. 
Fourth, the Research Agenda Matrix (Table 6) offers the first systematic 
linking of research gaps with specific theories, populations, and meth-
odological recommendations, providing a structured roadmap for future 
investigations.
Key findings reveal that AI awareness research remains fragmented, 
disproportionately focused on workforce dynamics in technologically 
advanced regions, with critical gaps in consumer, investor, and 
emerging market perspectives. The proposed AI Awareness Index and 
literacy workshops emerge as practical tools bridging theoretical in-
sights and organizational implementation. Geographic analysis dem-
onstrates concerning disparities, with 61 % of studies concentrated in 
China and the United States, while Sub-Saharan Africa and other 
developing regions remain underrepresented despite their critical 
importance for equitable AI adoption.
Future research should prioritize geographic and cultural expansion, 
diversify stakeholder focus to include underrepresented groups, and 
conduct longitudinal studies tracking awareness evolution alongside 
experimental validations of interventions. The systematic identification 
of seven research gaps—from evidence contradictions to population 
underrepresentation—provides clear directions for advancing the field 
toward comprehensive understanding of human-AI interactions across 
diverse global contexts.
